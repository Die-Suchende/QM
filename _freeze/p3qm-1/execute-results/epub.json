Williams.\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Two equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics\n\nQuantum mechanics was proposed at nearly the same time (see timeline above) using two different but equivalent formulations:\n\n- __Wave mechanics__: proposed by Schrödinger in 1925, following the de Broglie idea about matter waves (we'll see this towards the end of this chapter). We will start with this description, that you are more familiar with, for the first part of the course.\n\n- __Matrix mechanics__: developed by Heisenberg, Born and Jordan in 1925-1926, which uses non-commutative algebra and associates to each physical quantity and physical \"observables\" a matrix. This can be more convenient to describe two-level systems, the quantum harmonic oscillator or the angular momentum. We will start using this once we introduce the quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\nThese two approaches were then unified in a general formulation of quantum mechanics, developed by Dirac and Von Neumann in 1930-1932.\n\n_What led to the necessity of a quantum mechanics framework? Where and how did classical physics fail?_\n\nIn the following we will discuss the historical motivations that led to the development of quantum mechanics.\n\n## Blackbody radiation and the ultraviolet catastrophe\n\n\n- A body that totally absorbs all radiation that falls upon it is called a __blackbody__. You can think of it as a perfect absorber of radiation.\n- A blackbody is in thermal equilibrium, so it has a temperature $T$.\n- Since a blackbody absorbs energy and it is in thermal equilibrium, then it must also be a perfect emitter (i.e. emit across all wavelengths): a blackbody is a perfect absorber but it is also a perfect emitter.\n- Emitted radiation depends only upon the radiator's temperature, and the _total emissive power_, or _total emittance_, or _spectral radiance_, of a black hole follows the __Stefan-Boltzman law__:\n\n$$\nR(T) = \\sigma T^4,\n$${#eq-stefan-boltzmann-law}\n\nwhere we defined the Stefan's constant $$\\sigma = 5.61\\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W m}^{-2}\\mathrm{K}^{-4}.$$ \n\nA typical classic model for a perfect blackbody is a black cavity with a small hole (see @fig-bb-radiator): all the light entering is reflected multiple times across the black walls and is (almost completely) absorbed. Since the cavity is in thermal equilibrium, the emitted radiation depends only on its temperature, so the cavity emits like a black body. \n\n![A perfect blackbody radiator.](img/bb_radiator.jpg){#fig-bb-radiator}\n\n@eq-stefan-boltzmann-law describes the _total_ emittance, i.e. the emission power per unit area at all wavelengths, but what is the distribution of radiation across wavelengths (or frequencies) that a black body emits?\nIn mathematical terms, we previously found a form for $R(T)$, but want to know the _emittance at a given wavelength_ $R(\\lambda,T)$, and the total emittance is obviously obtained by integrating this over all the wavelengths:\n$$R(T)=\\int_0^{\\infty} R(\\lambda,T)d\\lambda.\n$${#eq-total-emittance-integral}\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThe emission spectra of black bodies (the energy emitted against the wavelength or frequency) depend only on their temperature $T$.\n:::\n\nIn the following we will also refer to the wavelength (or frequency) _monochromatic energy density_ $u(\\lambda,T)$ (or $u(\\nu,T)$).\nThe relation between the spectral emittance and the energy density can be shown [@richtmyer1969introduction] to be\n$$\nu(\\lambda,T)=\\frac{4}{c}R(\\lambda,T),\n$${#eq-energy-density-emittance}\nso from the measurement of the emission spectrum one could determine the energy density.\n\n\nSo what is the form of the emission spectrum of a black body?\nAlthough the spectrum of black-body radiation was _known observationally_ (how?!), its theoretical description has puzzled physicists at the end of the 19th Century and many attempts to describe this ran into trouble. It cannot be fully explained using classical physics, it requires quantum physics, as we will see in the following.\n\n### The black-body spectrum... observed? In the 1890s?!{.unnumbered}\nYou might be wondering how back in the days (1890-ish) physicists already knew the shape of the EM power spectrum... if you are, that's a good question and you're not alone. For this, let's thank Samuel Langley and his _bolometer_.\n\n> Ohhhh...\\\nLangley invented the bolometer,\\\nA very fine sort of thermometer.\\\nIt can measure the heat,\\\nOf a polar bear's feet\\\nAt the distance of half a kilometer.\n\n[via J.M.

This is known as the __ultraviolet catastrophe__, and indicates the failure of classical physics to explain the behaviour of thermal radiation.\n\n### Derivation of the Rayleigh-Jeans law{#sec-RJ-derivation}\n\nThe derivation can be found in [@richtmyer1969introduction] and follows principles from electromagnetism. \n\nImagine to have a 3D cubic cavity with side-length $L$. Inside the cavity we would expect to have standing waves (as in @fig-cavity-standing-waves), and the amount of radiation that the cavity can emit at a certain frequency is proportional to the number of modes it allows in that range.\nWe are interested in the following three questions:\n\n1. How many modes are there, per unit frequency, per unit volume, in the cavity?\n2. How much energy is needed to excite each mode, and how is the energy density distributed?\n\n__1. Determining the number of modes in the cavity__\n\nTo answer question 1, we proceed per steps:\n\n- Consider the cavity and impose periodic boundary conditions (we must have zero amplitude at the walls): then the allowed modes have the form $\\prod_i \\sin(k_i x_i)$, with $k_i = n_i\\pi L$, for integer $n_i$. Extending to each direction:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{n}|^2 = n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = (2\\nu L/c)^2 = (2 L/\\lambda)^2.\n$${#eq-nmodes-L}\n\n- How do we find the total number of modes that satisfy this condition? We would need to count all the combinations of the integer values $n_i$, but we can use a trick, which consists in assuming that the number of combinations is the volume of something that we call and \"n-space\": a 3D grid containing the values of $n_i$ in each direction (@fig-nspace).\n\nWe consider the n-space as a sphere: to find the number of modes we need to find its volume (this is a good approximation since the cavity length is much larger than the wavelength), _but_ we need to consider only the positive quadrant (1/8 of the volume of the sphere), _and_ we can have waves polarized along two planes (multiply the volume by 2 to account for two polarizations). With all this in mind, the volume of the n-space (positive) sphere with two possible polarizations is:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{d}N(|\\mathbf{n}|) &= \\frac{1}{8}\\times 2 \\times \\frac{4 \\pi}{3}(|\\mathbf{n}|^2)^{3/2}\\mathrm{d}|\\mathbf{n}|\\\\\n &= \\frac{\\pi}{3}(|\\mathbf{n}|^2)^{3/2}\\mathrm{d}|\\mathbf{n}|.\n\\end{align}\n\nFrom this, using @eq-nmodes-L, we find that the _number of modes per volume_ (in terms of the wavelength or the frequency) is\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}N(\\lambda) = \\frac{8\\pi L^3}{3\\lambda^3}\\mathrm{d}\\lambda, \\quad \\mathrm{d}N(\\nu)= \\frac{8\\pi \\nu^3 L^3}{3c^3}\\mathrm{d}\\nu\n$${#eq-nmodes-vol}\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n![Standing waves in a cavity.](img/bb1b.png){#fig-cavity-standing-waves}\n\n\n![Rayleigh scheme used for counting modes. Credits: [@richtmyer1969introduction]](img/nspace.png){#fig-nspace}\n:::\n\n- We now want to find the _number of modes per volume, per unit frequency (or wavelength)_, so we divide by $L^3$ and differentiate with respect to $\\nu$ (or $\\lambda$), obtaining respectively:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(\\nu)}{d\\nu}\\frac{1}{L^3}\\right|=\\frac{8\\pi \\nu^2}{c^3}\n$${#eq-nmodes-pervol-unitfreq}\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N(\\lambda)}{d\\lambda}\\frac{1}{L^3}\\right|=\\frac{8\\pi}{\\lambda^4}.\n$${#eq-nmodes-pervol-unitwavel}\n\nNote that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}N}{d\\nu}$ gives a negative result because the number of modes decreases with increasing wavelength.\n\nThese results hold general validity in both classical and quantum physics, but we did not address the second and third questions yet to determine the probability of occupying the modes and their corresponding energy.\nThis is where classical and quantum physics start diverging, and this is where this difference becomes important.\nThe Rayleigh-Jeans model uses a classical physics approach in addressing the above questions.\n\n2. __Determining the energy associated to the modes__\n\nTo find the energy associated to the modes we need to first ask: what is the probability that the modes are occupied?\nBased on classical physics all the modes have the _same probability_ of being occupied, i.e. all modes have the same chance of being produced and their number increases according to @eq-nmodes-pervol-unitfreq and @eq-nmodes-pervol-unitwavel.\n\n\nAccording to classical (statistical thermal) physics, the principle of _equipartition of energy_ states that, for a body in theraml equilibrium at temperature $T$, the energy associated to each degree of freedom is $1/2 k_B T$.\nSo the energy needed to excite each mode (accounting for two polarizations) is  $\\bar{E}=\\frac{1}{2}\\times 2 k_B T = k_B T$, and this _does not depend on the frequency_.\n\nWhat's the result for the energy density, if we put these things together?\n$$\nu(\\nu,T)=\\frac{8\\pi\\nu^2}{c^3} k_B T.\n$${#eq-en-density-rj}\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nNote that this means that the function $g(x)$ introduced in @eq-wien-en-density-freq is then $g(\\nu/T)=\\frac{k_B T}{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{x}$.\n\nIf we integrate @eq-en-density-rj over all the frequencies to find the total energy,\n$$\nE_{tot} = \\int_0^{\\infty} u(\\nu,T) d\\nu = \\infty\n$$\n\nwe obtain _infinite energy_ (not physically possible) - this is the __ultraviolet catastrophe__.\n:::\n\n\n\n### Planck's Law (1900)\n\nWe saw that Wien's approximation was good at low wavelengths (high frequencies), while the Rayleigh-Jeans law works better in the opposite regime of high wavelengths (low frequencies).\n\nIn 1900 Planck was able to derive a spectrum that fits the observed data of the blackbody spectral emission by assuming that energy comes in discrete quanta of energy\n$$\nE = h\\nu = hc/\\lambda,\n$${#eq-plancks-energy}\n\nwith $h=6.626\\times 10^{−34} \\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{Hz}^{−1} =  4.136\\times 10^{−15} \\mathrm{eV}\\cdot \\mathrm{Hz}^{−1}$ being Planck constant.\n\n_This marked the birth of quantum physics!_ And believe it or not, Planck's idea started from a lightbulb (see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TVZIBj7UA) below).\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TVZIBj7UA\n    title='Planck and the birth of quantum mechanics.' \n>}}\n\n\nThe Planck radiation spectrum for a black body's spectral radiance is:\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Planck's law for the spectral emittance\n$$\nR_\\lambda(\\lambda;

The number of modes counting was correct, but the mistake is in assuming that the equipartition of energy leads to each mode having an energy of $k_B T$, and that exciting each of these modes is equally probable.\n\nAccording to the classical theory, the average energy per mode can be obtained starting from the __Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution__\n$$\np(E)=e^{-E/k_B T},\n$${#eq-mw-distribution}\nand using the classical _equipartition of energy_:\n$$\n\\langle E\\rangle=\\frac{\\int E p(E) \\mathrm{d}E}{\\int p(E) \\mathrm{d}E} = \\frac{k_B^2 T^2}{k_B T} = k_B T\n$${#eq-avg-en-continuum}\n\nThis result is the one we previously determined in @sec-RJ-derivation, however the integration relies in a continuum distribution of energies.\n\nPlanck however used the discretisation of the energy levels to derive (in 2 months!) the correct form of the spectral radiance.\n\nUsing discretisation of the energy $E$ into discrete energy steps $\\epsilon=h\\nu$, from @eq-avg-en-continuum we obtain\n$$\n\\langle E\\rangle=\\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}n\\epsilon e^{-n\\epsilon/k_B T}}{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-n\\epsilon/k_B T}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\epsilon/k_B T}-1}.\n$${#eq-avg-en-discrete}\n\n### <span style=\"color:#336699;\">Exercise</span>\n\nDemonstrate the result of @eq-avg-en-discrete.\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=true}\n## Hint\nYou can use the result of the geometric series $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x^n=\\frac{1}{1-x}$ and its consequence $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(n+1)x^n=\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}$.\n:::\n\n<!-- <details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n \nStarting with the LHS of @eq-avg-en-discrete, substitute $x=e^{-h\\nu/k_B T}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\langle E\\rangle&=h\\nu\\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}nx^n}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x^n\\\\\n&=h\\nu x\\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(n+1)x^n}\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}x^n.\n\\end{align}\nUsing the properties in the hint:\n\\begin{align}\n\\langle E\\rangle&=\\frac{h\\nu x}{1-x}\\\\\n&=\\frac{h\\nu}{x^{-1}-1}\\\\\n&=\\frac{h\\nu}{e^{h\\nu/k_B T}-1}.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n</details> -->\n\n#### Consequences of Planck's model and comparison to the Rayleigh-Jeans model\n\nPlanck's introduction of discrete quanta of energy therefore affected the probability of occupation of the modes and their energy, as follows:\n\n- In classical physics the occupation of each mode was _equally possible_, but since modes are quantised and each quanta has energy $E=h\\nu$, exciting _higher modes is less probable_ because it requires more energy.\nThe probability that a mode will be occupied is given by the __Bose-Einstein distribution__ function:\n$$\np_{\\nu}=\\frac{1}{e^{h\\nu/k_B T}-1}\n$${#eq-be-distribution}\n\nNote that this distribution was introduced only in 1924; Planck's law can be re-derived using this from quantum statistics arguments.\n\n- The classical theory stated that each mode needed equal energy of $k_B T$ to be excited, in accordance with the _equipartition of energy_.

Using a radio telescope, they detected an isotropic radio 'noise' incident on Earth from all directions with the same intensity and filling the universe uniformly. The intensity was then measured at other wavelengths and the spectral distribution was observed to be consistent with a near-perfect $2.7$ K with $\\sigma(T) \\sim 20 \\mu K$ and a peak of emission in the microwave region (see @fig-cmb-spectra).\n\n![Based on their temperatures, different bodies emit at different ranges of frequency. The cosmic microwave background emits in the far infrared/microwave with a Wien's peak in the microwave.](img/bkg3.png){#fig-cmb-spectra}\n\nResearch conducted with the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on the COBE satellite measured a temperature of $2.725 \\pm 0.002$ K. Earlier experiments had detected some anisotropy in the background radiation due to the motion of the solar system, but COBE’s data revealed fluctuations in the radiation (@fig-cmb).\n\nLater, the WMAP mission produced a higher-resolution map of these anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation. The Planck satellite has since further refined this mapping, offering the most precise measurements of the key cosmological parameters to date.\n\n![Cosmic microwave background, showing the fluctuations around the average temperature of 2.74K.](img/cmb.jpeg){#fig-cmb}\n\n__Why do we observe these temperature fluctuations?__\nAt the very beginning, during the Big Bang, the Universe experienced an extremely rapid period of inflation that lasted only a tiny fraction of a second—around $10^{-32}$ s. By the end of this inflationary phase, the Universe had expanded by a staggering factor of about $10^{30}$ (that's _a lot_!).\n\nAt the beginning of the inflation and expansion, random quantum fluctuations were present, what happened to those? They were stretched to enormous, cosmological scales during this process!\nAs a result of these quantum fluctuations, the post-inflation universe now consist of vast regions with slightly different properties from one another, with certain areas having a slightly higher density of matter than others.\nSuch fluctuations are therefore necessary in Big Bang cosmology to create the non-uniformities required for galaxy formation. \nQuantum fluctuations are thought to have seeded large-scale structure in the universe!\n\n__Ok, but how are the density fluctuations and the thermal fluctuations related?__\n\nBefore the cosmic microwave background (CMB) was released, photons and particles were tightly linked, forming a unified 'fluid' of matter and radiation. At the time of recombination, around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the two decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely across the Universe. These photons carried with them a record of how matter and radiation were distributed at that moment.\nPhotons that came from denser regions lost more energy (since they needed to give away more energy to escape from a higher gravitational attraction), making them cooler, while those from less dense regions lost less energy and appeared warmer. As a result, the temperature fluctuations in the CMB reflect the density fluctuations in the early Universe, offering a 'snapshot' of its structure at the time of recombination.\n\n<!-- [End of lecture 1 (?)] -->\n\nLet's now go back to discussing how quantum mechanics was discovered. The ultraviolet catastrophe was one of the pieces of the puzzle, but not the only thing that could not be explained without introducing the concept of quantisation of energy.\n\n## Photoelectric effect\n\nThe photoelectric effect was discovered by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in 1887 during his work on radio waves. He observed that ultraviolet light affected the voltage at which sparking occurred between metal electrodes.\nPhilipp Lenard clarified this in 1902, showing that light striking a metal surface releases electrically charged particles (later identified as electrons), discovered by J.J. Thomson in 1897.\nThe photoelectric effect was then fully explained by Einstein in 1905, who got the Nobel prize for this (not for the relativistic theory!).\n\nTo explain this, let's introduce the setup: a vacuum chamber containing a metallic plate (it can be of different materials, e.g. sodium) hit by radiation at a certain wavelength and intensity, and a collector on the opposite side. Both sides are connected to a battery that can apply a voltage difference, and the collector is connected to an ammeter that measures the current of the charged particles hitting the collector.\nUse the following [simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/photoelectric/latest/photoelectric.html?simulation=photoelectric) (embedded below in the html file) and note what you observe when varying the following quantities:\n\n- Wavelength of incident light\n- Intensity of the incident light\n- Voltage of the battery\n- The material of the metallic plate\n\nIt is advisable to change only one parameter per time at first to better determine its effects.\nShow the relevant graphs on the simulator after varying the corresponding quantities indicated on the axis.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/cheerpj/photoelectric/latest/photoelectric.html?simulation=photoelectric\"\n        width=\"800\"\n        height=\"600\">\n</iframe>\n\n## What should we expect classically?\nClassically, if we treat light as a wave, we know that its energy depends on the intensity, and  therefore on the amplitude of the EM wave. The expectation is therefore that the energy of an electron emitted does not depend on the frequency of the light, but on its intensity.\nFurthermore, classically there is no reason why electrons should not be emitted if enough energy (intensity) is sent to the metallic plate, this should not depend on the frequency.\nWhat do we observe instead?\n<!-- Classically: intensity $\\sim$ EM wave amplitude $\\rightarrow$ intensity dependence, no frequency dependence, low intensity time-lag: not seen!. -->\n\n\n## What do we observe?\n__Simulated experiment 1: changing the material and the wavelength__\nLet's start with sodium, setting the voltage to zero and the intensity to 50%, and let's change the wavelength from higher to lower (from 850nm, in the IR, to the UV), what do we notice?\n\n- Nothing happens until the wavelength reaches a certain threshold $\\sim 530$ nm, where then electrons start being emitted by the metallic plate hit by the light\n- Below the threshold frequency (above the threshold  wavelength) we do not see emitted electrons even if we change the intensity \n- If we change the material, the critical frequency changes\n- The more we decrease the wavelength (increase the frequency) the faster the electrons move - this means they have more kinetic energy\n\n__Simulated experiment 2: changing the intensity and the voltage__\nLet's now fix a wavelength at which electrons are released and change first the intensity and then the voltage to see how the current is affected.\n\n- Let's start by setting a null voltage. We can see that the current increases with increasing intensity, and in fact we can observe that more electrons are released and all of them reach the collector at higher intensities.\n\n- __Positive voltage__: Let's now ramp up the voltage to the maximum positive value: we see that now the electrons are moving faster because of the potential, and the system reaches a saturation current \n\n- __Negative voltage__: If the value of the voltage is then decreased until it becomes negative, however, we can see that increasingly higher proportions of electrons start travelling towards the collector but come back, as now the potential is opposed to the initial motion of the electrons.\nSince the intensity changes the number of electrons emitted and therefore the photocurrent, at a fixed negative voltage the photocurrent will decrease with decreasing intensity.\nHowever, _regardless of light intensity_, we can eventually reduce the photocurrent to 0 with a negative __stopping voltage__ $V_0$ (see @fig-photocurrent_vs_v).\nThe stopping voltage decreases linearly with the light frequency, until it reaches 0: there is no photocurrent below a threshold frequency. \n\n![Photocurrent vs the potential difference, for two different values of the intensity and the same frequency. The stopping potential here is indicated with $\\Delta V_s$. For positive values of the potential difference, the photocurrent saturates for both intensities, while for negative values the stopping potential is eventually reached, regardless of the intensity.](img/Photoelectric_intensity_v0.jpg){#fig-photocurrent_vs_v}\n\n\n## Why we need a quantum explanation\nClassical physics does not explain why no photocurrent is recorded above the threshold wavelength: it should depend on the amplitude and therefore on the intensity, according to classical waves physics.\n\nWe need the quantisation of energy, as Einstein proposed, for this.\n\n- Electrons are emitted when a work of at least the _binding energy_ $E_b$ is paid to free them: this value depends on the material of the metallic plate.\nIf we consider that the energy coming from light is quantised and follows Planck's definition of quanta of energy $E=h\\nu$, then the minimum work $W$ that needs to be done to emit electrons is related to the kinetic energy of the electrons through the Einstein's photoelectric equation:\n$$\nE_b = h\\nu - W,\n$${#eq-photoel-eq}\nand the minimum (threshold) frequency necessary to eject electrons is $\\nu_{th} = W/h$. \n\nThe extra energy results in kinetic energy, which determines a maximum possible velocity (see @fig-photoel-slide)\n\n![Some observations of the photoelectric effect. Electrons are ejected only below a certain wavelength, and the lower the wavelength, the higher is the kinetic energy (max velocity).](img/photoelectric_effect_slide.png){#fig-photoel-slide}\n\n- The intensity determines the number of photons present in the light sent to the metallic plate, so higher intensity means that more electron can be extracted, if the frequency is above the threshold, and the photocurrent increases\n\n- The voltage can be tuned to increase the photocurrent by facilitating the motion of electrons incresing the voltage. A negative voltage can otherwise invert the motion of the electrons, and consequently reduce the photocurrent all the way to zero (see @fig-photocurrent-vs-v).\n\n![Photocurrent vs the voltage for different values of the intensity. For each intensity, increasing the voltage from 0 leads to an increase of intensity up to a plateau, where all the electrons emitted get to the collector.

This marks the end of the “plum pudding” model... but there is a problem.\nAccording to classical physics, electrons in orbits (accelerating charges) should emit radiation and therefore lose energy and spiral in to the nucleus. What does prevent this from happening? Classical physics could not provide a valid reason.\n\n### The Bohr model\n\nBohr (1913) solved this problem with a theory based mainly on classical mechanics, but with some new quantum ideas. Bohr's postulates were:\n\n1. Electrons move in _circular orbits_ determined by Newton's and Coulomb's laws.\n\n2. These circular orbits are _quantised_: the electron can't occupy _any_ region around the nucleus in a continuous way, but only stable orbits, hence it can't spiral into the center. Since the energy is constant with time, these are called _\"stationary states\"_ (we'll get back to this concept later).\n\n3. To go from one orbit to another, the electron must emit or absorb quanta of energy: this explained the discrete absorption and emission spectral lines!\n\nFor example, a spectral line at frequency $f$ is emitted when the atom transitions from the orbit at energy $E_i$ to the orbit at energy $E_f>E_i$:\n$ hf = E_i - E_f$\n\n4. The atomic angular momentum is quantized and the only orbits allowed are the ones for which the angular momentum is a multiple of $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2\\pi}$ (reduced Planck constant), i.e. $L = mvr = n\\hbar$. \nThis idea came from the fact that the Planck constant $h$ has dimension of angular momentum.\n\nStarting from that, Bohr predicted what the angular momentum and allowed orbits should have been for outer electrons in atoms with large mass number, and observed consistency with classical electrodynamics predictions.\n\n### Bohr's correspondence principle\n\n_Why did the quantum and classical results agree in atoms with large mass number? And why is angular momentum quantized?_\n\nBecause in large systems classical physics is a good approximation of quantum physics! This is the __correspondence principle__, and we will encounter it again later in the course.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## Bohr's correspondence principle\nPredictions of quantum theory must correspond to the predictions of classical physics in the region of sizes where classical theory is \"known to hold\".\n\nQuantum systems are usually described by quantum numbers $n$, and the classical limit should be recovered from the quantum results, for $n\\to \\infty$, i.e.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} [\\mathrm{quantum \\, physics \\, prediction} (n)] = [\\mathrm{classical \\, physics \\, prediction}]\n$$\n:::\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n![Quantized electron orbitals.

As Haas recalled: \"When I lectured to the Chemical-Physical Society of Vienna ... Lecher ... referred to the presentation during open discussion as \"a carnival joke\".\nHaas was in fact the first one to estimate the Bohr radius and to create a connection between atomic orbitals and Planck constant!\nIt is unclear what changed a shift in the opinion and led to the acceptance of Bohr's theory only three years later, but probably the times were not mature enough to accept quantum concepts more widely when Haas proposed his idea.\n\n### Compton's scattering\n\nWe saw that the Bohr's model explained the emission and absorption spectral lines.\nWhat happens if electrons interact with light at high frequencies such as X-ray? In this case it is reasonable to consider the electrons _free_, since the binding energy of the atom is very small compared to the X-ray energy, so the interaction between the high-frequency radiation and the electron would result in scattering.\n\n__Classical expectation__: when the EM wave is scattered off atoms, the wavelength of scattered radiation should be the same as the wavelength of the incident radiation.\nX-rays had been discovered in 1895 by W. K. Rontgen and were thought to be electromagnetic radiation of high frequency.\nBased on Thomson's theory (Thomson's scattering), the oscillating electric field of the incident radiation would make the electrons of the target atoms vibrate with the same frequency, and these would radiate electromagnetic waves at the same frequency. \n\n\nThis is not what Compton observed though. In 1922 Compton studied inelastic scattering of X-rays from graphite, and found that, with increasing scattering angle, a second peak was appearing at longer wavelength compared to the one of the incident light (@fig-compton-experiment). This change in wavelength between the peaks of the incoming beam and the scattered one is the __Compton shift__ and was found to be\n$$\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_f - \\lambda_i = \\frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\\cos(\\theta)),\n$${#eq-compton-shift}\nwhere $m_e$ is the mass of the electron and $\\theta$ is the scattering angle.\n\nThe constant in @eq-compton-shift, $\\dfrac{h}{m_e c}=2.4\\times 10^{-12}$ m is the __Compton wavelength of the electron__.\n\n![Compton scattering experiment: the secondary peak at longer wavelength starts appearing with increasing scattering angle.](img/Compdata.png){#fig-compton-experiment}\n\n#### Derivation of the Compton shift{.unnumbered}\n\nCompton used both special relativity and the quantisation of light to derive a formula for the Compton shift.

He suggested that this would for instance be the case for electrons: every electron was \"accompained\" by a (non electromagnetic!) wave, which \"piloted\" the electron through space.\n\n![Louis de Broglie, physicist and aristocrat.](img/Broglie_Big.jpg){#fig-de-broglie}\n\nThe wave-like and particle-like properties of light can be related by following equation for the momentum $p$ of the photon, $ p = \\hbar k = h \\nu/c = h/\\lambda$, where  $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wavenumber and $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$ are respectively the frequency and wavelength of the light wave.\n\nIn analogy to this, de Broglie introduced the concept of wavelength associated to any object moving with a momentum $p$ - the de Broglie wavelength.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## De Broglie wavelength\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{dB} = \\frac{h}{p}.\n$${#eq-de-broglie-wavel}\n:::\n\nWe can also use the form $p=\\hbar k$, using the de Broglie wavenumber $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda_{dB}$.\n\n### Interpretation of the Bohr's circular orbits\n\nThe idea of de Broglie gives a _qualitative_ explanation of Bohr's idea of quantized orbits, as the waves associated to the electrons would interfer, leaving areas of destructive interference where \"electrons are forbidden\", while only standing waves would be allowed to \"fit\" in the Bohr's circular orbits.

Upon repeating the experiment, different results were found and electron Bragg scattering was accidentally measured!\nThe reason was that the prolonged heating had changed the internal structure of the atoms in the nickel target, forming large single-crystal regions in the polycrystalline sample, which provided an ideal lattice to observe electron diffraction.\n\nFrom the diffraction equation, $λ = 2d sin((π − θ)/2)$ for Ni with $d = 0.091$ nm, the peak observed at $θ = 50\\deg$ was consistent with the the Broglie wavelength of 54 eV electrons.\nAt the same time and independently, George Thomson also observed electron diffraction with aluminium films, and in 1937 he shared the Nobel Prize with Davisson (not with Germer, who had a B plan for his career and became an offbeat rock climber - always think about a B plan...).\n\nSuch experiments have since been extended to neutrons, atoms, molecules, fullerene ($C_{60}$), etc.\n\n\n## (1926) Schrödinger's atomic model: a _really_ quantum model of the atom\n\nYou may wonder what I mean with \"_really_ quantum model of the atom\", when Bohr already introduced the quantisation of energy levels, even managing to explain the spectral lines and de Broglie introduced the concept of waves.\nWe've been very vague about the physical meaning we give to such \"pilot waves that guide the electrons through space\", but it seems that we have all the ingredients for a really quantum model of the atom. What else do we need?\n\nIn the following chapter(s) we will see that the notion of representing a particle as a localized wave or wave group leads naturally to limitations on simultaneously measuring position and momentum of the particle (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle).\n\nThe reality is that the Bohr's model, even with the de Broglie interpretation, still doesn't capture the _probabilistic_ nature of quantum physics.\nThis is where we really start getting into the more fundamental differences in nature between classical and quantum physics.\n\n__What is different about quantum physics?__\n\nWe talked about quantised light (photons) and quantised circular orbits for the atom, and we saw that we _need_ to introduce these to explain phenomena that can't be explained by using classical physics.\nHowever, the most striking difference between classical and quantum physics lies in their fundamental nature.\n\n__Classical physics__ is ___deterministic___: given a system, if you have enough information about it (i.e. about the initial configuration of an experiment) and know the physics to describe its dynamics, you can _determine_ what will happen next to said system, i.e. what configuration it's going to be in after some time. An important aspect is that the process of observing (_measuring_) a classical system does not affect the final configuration of the system. We'll get into more details about this later.\n\nClassically, an electron in Bohr's model is still imagined as a particle orbiting about the nucleus. However, that's not exactly the correct picture, as de Broglie pointed out. At such small scales, we have to abandon the classical description and resort to the quantum interpretation.\n\n\n__Quantum physics__, in contrast to classical physics, is ___probabilistic___.\nWhat does this mean for the electron? It means that actually the electron is not really a particle: just like light, it can behave like a wave and its description is given by a _wavefunction_, a probability distribution indicating the regions where the electron is more likely to be (observed after measurement) (@fig-cl-quant-el).\nThe region of space around the nucleus where there is a high probability of observing the electron (~90-95%) is called an _orbital_, while'forbidden' regions around the nucleus are the _nodes_ (@fig-quantum-el).\n\n![Classical vs quantum electron visualization.](/img/classical_quantum_el.jpg){#fig-cl-quant-el}\n\n![Probability distribution of electron for different orbitals (1s, 2s, 3s). More densely coloured regions indicate areas where electrons are more likely to be. White areas (nodes) are regions where electrons have zero probability of being found.

It can take positive integer values (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n- __Angular Momentum Quantum Number__ ($l$): Defines the shape of the orbital and can take values from 0 to $n-1$ for each value of $n$. Each value of l corresponds to a specific type of orbital (s, p, d, f...).\n\n- __Magnetic Quantum Number__ ($m_l$): Describes the orientation of the orbital in space and can take integer values from $-l$ to $+l$, including $0$.\n\n- __Spin Quantum Number__($m_s$): Specifies the electron's spin direction, which can be either +1/2 or -1/2.\n\nWe'll get back to these quantum numbers later on, when we study more in detail the orbital angular momentum and spin.\n\n<!-- The 'state' of any quantum system is in general defined by a wavefunction that describes the probability amplitude that upon observation the system will take a specific configuration.\nThis means that it is intrinsically not possible to determine exactly what the exact configuration of a system is before observing that! -->\n\nWe are starting to introduce concepts that are very different (if not inexistent) in classical physics, such as:\n\n- _State_\n- _Superposition_\n- _Measurement_ (its interpretation and implications in quantum physics)\n- (and more...)\n\n<!-- Don't worry, we will come back to explaining these more in detail in due time, and these are concepts that will accompain us during the whole course. -->\n\n<!-- A quantum system is by nature defined by a distribution of probabilities in which it can be found after an observation i.e. _measurements_, which _perturbs_ the system.\nWhat you observe after a measurement is one of the possible outcomes that a system in a _superposition_ of possible configurations had before. -->\n\nThese concepts will be discussed in greater detail during the course (they will in fact be our 'bread and butter during' the semester!) and we will come back to explaining them in due time. Now, let's try to understand the probabilistic quantum nature with a known experiment: Young's double slit experiment.\n\nIn the next chapter we will see how the wave-particle duality can be observed and understood through the double slit experiment with electrons (and neutrons).\n\n\n\n\n## Recap\n\n- Black body spectrum first investigated by Wien (1894) via thermodynamic arguments\n- Rayleigh–Jeans model in 1900 argued from equipartition and mode density\n$\\rightarrow$ ever-increasing modes with same energy: ultraviolet catastrophe!\n- Wien model worked at high frequencies, Rayleigh at low frequencies\n- Planck (1900) interpolated between the two, fitting data at all wavelengths and deriving Stefan’s Law for total radiated power\n- Post-hoc understanding of Planck model: discretisation of EM mode energies as integer multiples of $\\epsilon = h\\nu$.\n\n- Photoelectric effect and Bohr atomic spectra evidence quanta of light and quantized atomic energy levels\n- Compton effect shows particle nature of light\n- de Broglie: wave–particle duality (and wave mechanics).
