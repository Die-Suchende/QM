You can think of it as a perfect absorber of radiation.\n- A black body is in thermal equilibrium, so it has a temperature $T$.\n- If it absorbs energy then it must also re-radiate it to stay in thermal equilibrium.\n- A black body is a perfect absorber but it is also a perfect emitter.\n- Emitted radiation depends only upon the radiator's temperature, following the __Stefan-Boltzman law__:\n\n$$ R(T) = \\sigma T^4,$$\nwhere we defined the Stefan's constant $$\\sigma = 5.61\\times 10^{-8} \\mathrm{W m}^{-2}\\mathrm{K}^{-4}.$$ \n\n![A perfect black body radiator.](img/bb_radiator.jpg){#fig-bb-radiator}\n\nWhat is the distribution of radiation across wavelengths (or frequencies) that a black body emits?\n\n<!-- Earlier in this chapter we defined the _radiant flux_ (@eq-flux) as the energy received per second, per unit area. -->\n\nWe want to know the power emitted per unit wavelength $\\lambda$, per unit area, per unit solid angle (steradian): the __spectral radiance__ $B_\\lambda(\\lambda;T)$.\n\nFor a perfect emitter, radiation is emitted:\n\n- _equally_ from the surface of an object\n- _isotropically_ over solid angle.\n\n_The emission spectra of black bodies (the energy emitted against the wavelength or frequency) depend only on their temperature $T$._\n\nSo what is the form of the emission spectrum of a black body?\nAlthough the spectrum of black-body radiation was _known observationally_ (how?!), its theoretical description has puzzled physicists at the end of the 19th Century and many attempts to describe this ran into trouble. It cannot be fully explained using classical physics, it requires quantum physics, as we will see in the following.\n\n### The black-body spectrum... observed? In the 1890s?!{.unnumbered}\nYou might be wondering how back in the days (1890-ish) physicists already knew the shape of the EM power spectrum... if you are, that's a good question and you're not alone. For this, let's thank Samuel Langley and his _bolometer_.\n\n> Ohhhh...\\\nLangley invented the bolometer,\\\nA very fine sort of thermometer.\\\nIt can measure the heat,\\\nOf a polar bear's feet\\\nAt the distance of half a kilometer.\n\n[via J.M.

If it were true the power emitted at short wavelengths would be infinite! This is known as the _Ultraviolet Catastrophe_, and indicates the failure of classical physics to explain the behaviour of thermal radiation.\n\n### Wien's approximation\n\nWien's approximation, also referred to as Wien's law (not to be confused with 'Wien's displacement law'), is a good model for the observed spectrum at short wavelength (high frequencies) $hc\\gg k_BT\\lambda$, but it is not accurate at high wavelengths.\nWien's approximation is described by the form below.\n\n$$\nB_\\lambda^\\mathrm{Wien}(\\lambda; T) = \\frac{2 hc^2}{\\lambda^5}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right)\n$${#eq-Wien_approx}\n\n::: {.cell slideshow='{\"slide_type\":\"skip\"}' execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nB_wien=2 * h.value *c.value**2 * np.exp(-h.value*c.value/((l*1e-9)*k_B.value*T)) / (l*1e-9)**5;\n\nplt.plot(l, B_rj, label=\"Rayleigh-Jeans law\")\nplt.plot(l, B_wien, label=\"Wien's approximation\")\n\nplt.xlabel(r'Wavelength $\\lambda$ (nm)')\nplt.ylabel(r'Spectral Radiance $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T=4000K)$ (Wm$^{-3}$sr$^{-1}$)')\nplt.title('Spectral radiance')\nplt.ylim([0,5e12])\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend();\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of the spectral radiance plotted using the Rayleigh-Jeans law (@eq-rayleigh-jeans-law) and the Wien's approximation (@eq-Wien_approx).](p3qm-1_copy_files/figure-html/fig-rayleigh-wien-plot-output-1.png){#fig-rayleigh-wien-plot}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Planck's Law\nIn 1900 Planck was able to derive a spectrum that fit the data by assuming that energy comes in discrete quanta of energy $E = h\\nu = hc/\\lambda$, with $h$ being a constant, Planck constant.\nThis marked the birth of quantum physics!

The process of observing a classical system does not affect it.\n\nClassically, an electron is thought as a point-like particle orbiting about the nucleus. However, that's not exactly the correct picture. At such small scales, we have to abandon the classical description and resort to the quantum interpretation.\n\n__Quantum physics__, in contrast to classical physics, is ___probabilistic___.\nWhat does this mean for the electron? It means that actually the electron is not really a point-like particle, it is more like a wave, and more specifically a _wavefunction_, which determines a probability distribution, indicating the regions where electrons are more likely to be (observed after measurement).\n\nThe 'state' of any quantum system is in general defined by a wavefunction that describes the probability that upon observation the system will take a specific configuration.\nThis means that it is intrinsically not possible to determine exactly what the exact configuration of a system is before observing that!\n\n![Classical vs quantum electron description.](/img/classical_quantum_el.jpg){#fig-cl-quant-el}\n\n![Probability distribution of electron for different orbitals (1s, 2s, 3s). More densely coloured regions indicate areas where electrons are more likely to be. White areas (nodes) are regions where electrons have zero probability of being found.

Now, let's try to understand the probabilistic quantum nature with a known experiment: Young's double slit experiment.\n\n\n# The double-slit experiment\n\nIf you want a thorough description of the double-slit experiment and how this impacted the development of quantum physics, there are endless resources you can read. I have a personal preference in this regard, and it's provided by Feynman. His \"Lectures on Physics\" are freely available online here, and I recommend reading the first three chapters of the third book. They are very descriptive, so do not be scared by the length, but they are very useful for a fundamental understanding of the physics behind the mathematical description!\n\nI am not as good as Feynman, so forgive me if I don't make an effort at reinventing the wheel by trying to reformulate what he perfectly explains, I'll just summarise these concepts briefly.\nThe three chapters from Lectures on Physics can be found at the following link, also embedded below:\n\n- [Chapter 1 - Quantum behaviour](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html)\n- [Chapter 2 - The Relation of Wave and Particle Viewpoints](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_02.html)\n- [Chapter 3 - Probability Amplitudes](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_03.html)\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html\" id=\"iframe_container\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"450\" width=\"700\"></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_02.html\" id=\"iframe_container\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"450\" width=\"700\"></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_03.html\" id=\"iframe_container\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"450\" width=\"700\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### <span style=\"color:#336699;\">Question</span>\n\nShow that if we have two stars with luminosities (units $W$) $L_1$ and $L_2$ at the same distance $r=10\\mathrm{pc}$, their difference in the apparent magnitudes is the same as the difference of the absolute magnitudes:\n\n\\begin{align}\nM_1 - M_2 = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\frac{L_1}{L_2}\n\\end{align}\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\nUse the relationship between flux and luminosity and the properties of logarithms.\n:::\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\nFor two stars _at the same distance_ $r$ (e.g. two stars in a binary), we can write\n\\begin{align}\nm_1 - m_2 &= -2.5\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{L_1}{4\\pi r^2} \\times \\frac{4\\pi r^2}{L_2} \\right)\\\\\n&= -2.5\\log_{10}\\frac{L_1}{L_2}\n\\end{align}\n\nHaving defined the absolute magnitude using the zero point flux above, for the i-th star (i.e. for i=1,2) with luminosities $L_i$ at distances of 10pc, the absolute magnitude is:\n$M_i = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\dfrac{L_i}{L_0}}$\n\nTherefore:\n\\begin{align*}\nM_1 - M_2 & = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{L_0}} - \\left(-2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_2}{L_0}}\\right) \\\\\n& = -2.5\\log_{10} L_1 +2.5\\log_{10} L_0 + 2.5\\log_{10} L_2 - 2.5\\log_{10} L_0 \\\\\n& = -2.5 \\log_{10} L_1 + 2.5 \\log_{10} L_2\\\\\n& = -2.5 \\log_{10}{\\frac{L_1}{L_2}}\n\\end{align*}\n\n- For two stars at the same distance of 10pc from the observer, the difference in the apparent magnitude is equal to the difference in the absolute magnitude.\n\n\n\n# Recap\n\n- Black bodies are perfect absorbers and emitters that absorb and emit at all wavelengths\n- __Planck radiation law__ gives the shape of the black-body emission spectrum\n- __Wien's displacement law__ relates the peak emission wavelength to the temperature\n- __Stefan-Boltzmann law__ can be used to find the total power radiated by a black body\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nn=2\nprint(n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
