In short: __why will we keep using single plane waves in the following?__\n\nIn the previous chapter we saw that we could in principle describe a free particle using a single plane wave (@eq-plane-wave), but this leads to complication, such as infinite delocalisation in space. We saw that to get around this (and other) issues, we can consider a sum (or _linear combination_) of wavefunctions with different weights, and we saw that in the continuum, for infinitely many waves, this leads to a Fourier transform of a wavefunction in momentum space (@eq-wavepacket-cont).\n\nThere is one important principle that we need to keep in mind.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n\nIf two wavefunctions $\\Psi_1$ and $\\Psi_2$ are both solutions of a wave equation which is __linear__ and __homogeneous__, the __superposition principle__ ensures that any linear combination $c_1 \\Psi_1 + c_2 \\Psi_2$ (with constants $c_1$ and $c_2$), is also a solution of the same wave equation.\n\nThis can be extended to as many waves as we want! So in general it is enough to find the solution to a wave equation as a plane wave than as a wavepacket.\n\n:::\n\n## The time-dependent Schrödinger equation\n\nThe energy of a free particle is given by its kinetic energy. For a particle of mass $m$, moving in one direction $x$ with momentum $p_x$, we can write\n\n$$\nE = \\frac{p_x^2}{2m}.\n$${#eq-energy-free-particle}\n\nLet's consider a plane wave to describe it...\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=Ae^{i(kx-\\omega t)}=Ae^{i(p_x x-Et)/\\hbar},\n$${#eq-plane-wave-xt}\nwhere we used the relations $k=p_x/\\hbar$ and $\\omega=E/\\hbar$.\n\nIf we consider the wavefunction at the time $t=0$, $\\Psi(x,0)=Ae^{ikx}=Ae^{ip_x/\\hbar}$ we can see from @eq-plane-wave-xt that the time evolution of a wavefunction $\\Psi(x)$ of definite energy can be obtained from\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=e^{-iEt/\\hbar}\\Psi(x,0),\n$${#eq-plane-wave-evolution}\n\nso during the time evolution of a quantum state having a defined energy _only the phase is evolving_, and the state $\\Psi(x,t)$ is called a __stationary state__, satisfying the condition\n\n$$\n|\\Psi(x,t)|^2=|\\Psi(x,0)|^2.\n$${#eq-prob-t-prob-0}\n\nIf we differentiate @eq-plane-wave-xt with respect to time, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Psi(x,t)}{\\partial t}=-\\frac{iE}{\\hbar}\\Psi(x,t),\n$${#eq-plane-wave-dt}\n\nand if we differentiate twice with respect to $x$, we find\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Psi(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}=-\\frac{p_x^2}{\\hbar^2}\\Psi(x,t).\n$${#eq-plane-wave-d2x}\n\nUsing @eq-energy-free-particle, we see that @eq-plane-wave-xt satisfies the partial differential wave equation\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}  \\Psi(x,t) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\Psi(x,t).\n$${#eq-schrodinger-eq-no-potential}\n\nThis is the __one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a free particle__.\n\nNow, this wave equation is _linear_ and _homogeneous_, so a linear superposition of plane waves, such as the wavepacket of @eq-wavepacket-cont, will still be a solution of @eq-schrodinger-eq-no-potential.\n\nWe can generalise the Schrödinger equation of @eq-schrodinger-eq-no-potential to the case where a particle is not free, but it is subject to a time-independent potential $U(x)$, hence it is acted on by a force $F=-\\frac{d U}{d x}$.\n\nIn this case, we get the following form of the _one-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a particle moving in a potential_.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## One-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}  \\Psi(x,t) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} \\Psi(x,t)+U(x)\\Psi(x,t),\n$${#eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep}\n\nwhere $U(x)$ is a time-independent potential.\n\n:::\n\nWhilst we are considering a time-independent potential here, we can have an even more general form of the Schrödinger equation with a time-dependent potential $U(x,t)$. In this course however we will mostly focus on the case of time-independent potentials.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nNote that the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE)(@eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep) contains a _first order time derivative_ $\\partial/\\partial t$, which means that if the initial value of the wavefunction is given at an initial time $t=t_0$, i.e. $\\Psi(x,t_0)$, then the value of the wavefunction at any later time $t$ can be found by solving the TDSE.\n\nTherefore the fundamental task is to obtain a solution to $\\Psi(x,t)$ to the Schrödinger equation (@eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep) that satisfies the given initial conditions.\n\n:::\n\n### Operators in the Schrödinger equation{#sec-op-SE}\n\nLet's start to introduce some words that we will use during the whole course and that we will describe more in detail later in the chapter.\n\nThe first thing it is useful to introduce here is the concept of __operator__, which are mathematical entities that transform one wavefunction into another.\n\nThe term on the left hand side of @eq-schrodinger-eq-no-potential, $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$, applied on the wavefunction, is the _total energy operator_ - a mathematical function (of time, $t$) acting on the wavefunction that returns the total energy, and we indicate with the symbol $\\hat{E}$.\nTo indicate operators we use the hat symbol.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Total energy operator\n\n$$\n\\hat{E} = i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \n$${#eq-total-en-op}\n:::\n\nThis operator yields the same result of another operator that also gives the total energy of the system, but acts on the spatial coordinates instead of time. This is the the _Hamiltonian operator_, $\\hat{H}$, which describes the sum of the potential and kinetic energy operators, respectively $\\hat{T}=\\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ and $\\hat{U}$.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Hamiltonian operator\n\n$$\n\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}+U(x,t).\n$${#eq-hamiltonian-op}\n\n:::\n\n\nFor the right hand side of @eq-schrodinger-eq-no-potential we can also define the _momentum operator_ $\\hat{p}$ (in 1D) as below.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Momentum operator (1D)\n\n$$\n\\hat{p}_x=-i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}.\n$${#eq-momentum-op}\n\n:::\n\nWe will talk more about operators later in the chapter.\n\nHaving introduced this formalism, we can cast the TDSE of @eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep in the following alternative forms:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(x,t) = \\hat{H}\\Psi(x,t),\n$${#eq-TDSE-H}\n\n$$\n\\hat{E}\\Psi(x,t) = \\hat{H}\\Psi(x,t).\n$${#eq-TDSE-EH}\n\n\n\n### <span style=\"color:#336699;\">Exercise</span>\n\nTest the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with a plane wave of amplitude $A$ and a flat potential $U(x)=U$. What is the energy obtained?\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n \n$\\Psi(x,0)=Ae^{i(kx-\\omega t)}$.\n\n-- Add rest of solution --\n\n</details>\n\n\n### Continuity condition\n\nThe following is important and clarifies why in the previous chapter we imposed certain conditions on the wavefunctions.\n\nIf the potential $U(x)$ is a continuous function of $x$, then every function in @eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep, i.e. $\\Psi(x,t), \\partial\\Psi/\\partial t, \\partial \\Psi/\\partial x$, must be continuous.\n\nIf $U(x)$ shows any finite discontinuities (jumps) with $x$, then $\\partial^2\\Psi(x)/\\partial x^2$ should also have corresponding finite jumps. For this to happen, we need $ \\partial \\Psi/\\partial x$ to be continuous with $x$: if this were not the case, $\\partial^2\\Psi(x)/\\partial x^2$ would be infinite at points in which $ \\partial \\Psi/\\partial x$ changed discontinuously.\nThe continuity of $ \\partial \\Psi/\\partial x$ on the other end also implies that $\\Psi(x,t)$ and $\\partial\\Psi/\\partial t$ have to be continuous.\n\n_What about the continuity with time?_\n\nIf $U(x,t)$ is a continuous function of $t$, so will be $\\Psi(x,t)$ and $\\partial\\Psi/\\partial t$. However, if $U(x,t)$ has a finite jump with time, $\\partial\\Psi/\\partial t$, while $\\Psi(x,t)$ will still be a continuous function of $t$.\n\n\n### The time-dependent Schrödinger equation in 3D\n\nWe can generalise the 1D TDSE to 3D as follows:\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}  \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)+U(\\mathbf{r})\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t),\n$${#eq-TDSE-3D}\nwhere\n$$\n\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\n$${#eq-laplacian}\n\nis the Laplacian operator.\n\nIt is useful now to refresh the definitions of gradient and divergence as well, as they will be used in the following section.\nThe gradient $\\nabla$ is defined as\n$$\n\\nabla=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z},\n$${#eq-gradient}\n\nand we can build the divergence from the gradient, by associating an unit vector to each partial derivative, for each direction.\nRemember that gradient and Laplacian act on functions, whereas the divergence is a vector, so can be used for scalar or vector product with another vector.\n\n## Probability conservation\n\nIn the previous chapter we explained how, according to the Born's postulate, the wavefunction has the role of probability amplitude and it can be used to define the probability density (see @eq-prob-density-wavefunction-1D).\n\nWe have also seen that this leads to the normalization condition for the wavefunction (@eq-normalization-wavefunc), since the probability to find the particle over all space must be equal to one.\n\nLet's now consider what happens to the probability as time changes. Since there is no loss of information, we expect this to be unchanged, so the wavefunction $\\Psi(x,t)$ should be normalised at all times: $\\int |\\Psi(x,t)|^2dx=1$.\nThis means that __the probability is conserved__ over the whole volume, and mathematically we can write this condition, that we will demonstrate in the following, as\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_V P(\\mathbf{r},t) d\\mathbf{r} = 0.\n$$\n\nUsing the definition of probability density (@eq-prob-density-wavefunction-1D), we can write the left hand term above as\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_V P(\\mathbf{r},t) d\\mathbf{r} = \\int_V d\\mathbf{r} \\frac{d}{dt}(\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t))=\\int_V d\\mathbf{r} \\left[\\Psi^* \\left(\\frac{d\\Psi}{dt}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{d\\Psi^*}{dt}\\Psi\\right) \\right],\n$$\n\nwhere we could take the derivative $d/dt$ inside the integral because the probability function is continuous with continuous partial derivatives.\n\nApplying the TDSE (@eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep) we can cast this in the form\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_V d\\mathbf{r} P(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\int_V d\\mathbf{r} \\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}\\left[\\Psi^* \\frac{d^2}{d\\mathbf{r}^2}\\Psi-\\left(\\frac{d^2}{d\\mathbf{r}^2}\\Psi^*\\right) \\Psi \\right].\n$${#eq-prob-cons-1}\n\nUsing the definitions of gradient and divergence (@eq-gradient), we can rewrite @eq-prob-cons-1 in the form\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_V d\\mathbf{r} P(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\int_V \\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot \\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}\\left[\\Psi^* \\nabla\\Psi-\\left(\\nabla\\Psi^*\\right) \\Psi \\right].\n$${#eq-prob-cons-2}\n\nFor convenience we can introduce the _vector field_\n$$\n\\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r},t)= -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}\\left[\\Psi^* \\nabla\\Psi-\\left(\\nabla\\Psi^*\\right) \\Psi \\right],\n$${#eq-probability-current}\n\nwhich is known as __probability current__ or __probability flux__, and @eq-prob-cons-2 can be written as\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_V d\\mathbf{r} P(\\mathbf{r},t) = -\\int_V \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r},t) d\\mathbf{r} = -\\int_S \\mathbf{j}\\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = 0,\n$${#eq-prob-cons-3}\n\nwhere in the last passage we used the divergence theorem (aka Green's theorem), stating that the integral of the divergence of a vector, over a volume $V$, is equal to the surface integral of the component of that vector along the outward normal, taken over a closed surface $S$.\n\nNow, the last integral over the surface $S$ in the last integral of @eq-prob-cons-3 extends to infinity, and since the wavefunction is not fully delocalised (because it can be normalised), then its extension to infinity will be zero and the integral is overall equal to zero ($\\Psi\\to 0$ if $\\mathbf{r}\\to \\infty$).\n\nNotably, from this result in @eq-prob-cons-3 we can say that the probability current respects a __conservation law__, which has the form of a continuity equation, as below.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Conservation equation for the probability\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} P(\\mathbf{r},t) = -\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot \\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r},t).\n$${#eq-probability-conservation}\n\nPhysically this means that any change in probability density at a point is balanced by a flow of probability current into or out of that (differential) region.\n\n:::\n\nWhat do we learn from this? That physical wavefunctions must have finite probability fluxes: we cannot have infinite rates of probability density moving between spatial regions (or more generally between regions in any generalised coordinates of the system).\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n\n## Important - Implications for wavefunctions\n\n1. The term $\\nabla\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})$ in $J(\\mathbf{r})$ means that the spatial wavefunction must be _continuous_, to avoid delta-function spikes in flux;\n2. $\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{j}$ in the probability conservation (@eq-prob-cons-3) means that the wavefunction must be _differentiable_ everywhere, $\\frac{\\partial\\Psi}{\\partial x}$ must be continuous, otherwise there would be an unphysical divergence of $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t}$ (cfr @eq-probability-conservation).\n3. Square-integrability coming from the normalization condition means that $\\Psi(x)\\to 0$ for $|x|\\to \\infty$.\n\nThere is a caveat: for infinite potentials and infinitely fast changes, the second of these rules no longer holds.\n:::\n\n\n\n<!-- As $J(\\mathbf{r})$ contains both $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\nabla\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})$ terms, both the wavefunction and its derivative must be continuous functions, i.e. $\\Psi$ must be continuous and differentiable, or smooth. -->\nSo $\\Psi$ must be continuous and differentiable (have continuous derivatives), or smooth.\nThese requirements, that we anticipated in the previous chapter, in addition to the established normalization requirement of square-integrability, are the key to deriving the boundary conditions that allow us to find wavefunctions for various quantum systems, seen in the following chapters.\n\nAnother important result is that the probability current (@eq-probability-current) is identically zero if either:\n\n1. the wavefunction $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ is real-valued; or\n2. it has a complex phase which applies uniformly to all space positions $x$, hence unaffected by the space derivative $\\nabla$.\n\nThe first of these is trivial to see: if $\\Psi$ is real valued then $\\Psi^* = \\Psi$ and $(\\nabla\\Psi^*) = \\nabla\\Psi$, so the two terms in $\\mathbf{j}$ (cf. @eq-probability-current) cancel.\n\nThe second is slightly less obvious: if $\\Psi = e^{i\\Phi}\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$, then $\\Psi^*\\nabla\\Psi = e^{i\\Phi}e^{-i\\Phi}\\psi\\nabla\\psi=\\psi\\nabla\\psi=\\Psi\\nabla\\Psi^*$, and again the two terms cancel.\n\nThe consequence of this second case in particular is that _stationary states, whose time-evolution is a uniform, energy-coupled phase $e^{iEt/\\hbar}$, have no probability flux_.\nWhich is a good thing: they are stationary states precisely because their probability distribution is time-invariant, so there’d better not be any probability current flowing between regions!\n\n\n\n\n## The time-independent Schrödinger equation\n\nLet's go back to considering the TDSE in 1D, @eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep.\n\nIf the potential $U(x)$ is time-independent, we can use the method of separation of variables for the wavefunction:\n\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=\\psi(x)T(t).\n$$\n\nThen\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = \\psi(x)\\frac{dT}{dt},\\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Psi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2}T(t),\n$$\n\nand we can rewrite the TDSE, @eq-schrodinger-eq-time-dep, as\n$$\ni\\hbar \\psi(x)\\frac{dT}{dt}=-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}T(t)+V(x)\\psi(x)T(t).\n$$\n\nDividing this by $\\Psi=\\psi T$, we obtain\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{t}=-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{1}{\\psi(x)}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2}+V(x),\n$${#eq-TISE-der-1}\n\nwhere it is clear that all the time dependence is on the left hand side and all the space dependence on the right hand side, so this is of the form: function of t = function of x, for all t and all x. This means that both sides must be equal to a constant! We call this constant $E$, as it represents the total energy - we can see this by comparing the operators on each side to the total energy operator and the Hamiltonian operator defined in @eq-total-en-op and @eq-hamiltonian-op.\n\nFrom the RHS of @eq-TISE-der-1, we obtain the (1D) __time-independent Schrödinger equation__.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Time-independent Schrödinger equation\n\n$$\n\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(x)\\right]\\psi(x) = E \\psi(x),\n$${#eq-TISE}\nwhich can also be written as\n$$\n\\hat{H}\\psi(x)=E\\psi(x)\n$${#eq-TISE-H}\nusing the definition of the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ (@eq-hamiltonian-op).\n\n:::\n\nIn the following section we will see that this is an _eigenvalue equation_.\n\nFrom the LHS of @eq-TISE-der-1, we can extract\n\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{t}=E\\implies i\\hbar \\frac{dT}{t}=ET(t),\n$${#eq-SE-time-dep-only}\n\nwhich is easy to solve:\n$$\nT(t)=C e^{-iEt/\\hbar},\n$${#eq-time-op}\n\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant and we can set it to $C=1$.\n\nWe can then write the general solution of a wavefunction with separable variables (again, this holds for $U$ independent of $t$), as a stationary state.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Stationary states\n\nA stationary state is a state with a _defined total energy_, $E$, and has the following form:\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=\\psi(x)e^{-iEt/\\hbar}.\n$${#eq-stationary-state}\n\nThe state (i.e. the wavefunction) itself is evolving with time, but the time evolution is just a phase, hence _the probability density is time-independent_:\n$$\n|\\Psi(x,t)|^2=\\Psi^*(x,t)\\Psi(x,t)=\\psi^*(x)e^{iEt/\\hbar}\\psi(x)e^{-iEt/\\hbar}=|\\Psi(x,0)|^2\n$${#eq-stationary-state-prob}\n:::\n\nIn fact, we have already anticipated this at the beginning of the chapter when we looked at a plane wave,  @eq-plane-wave-evolution.\n\n## Operators, expectation values and eigenfunctions\n\nIn this section we will introduce some notation and concepts that will be _fundamental_ for the whole course (and for other courses next year).\n\n### Operators\n\nIn @sec-op-SE we have already anticipated what operators are.\n\n_Operators are mathematical entities that transform a wavefunction onto another wavefunction_.\n\nIn fact, we have already defined the _Hamiltonian operator_ (@eq-hamiltonian-op), which gives the total energy of the system, and the _momentum operator_ (@eq-momentum-op).\nBoth of these quantities are physical _observables_, i.e. physical quantities that we can measure.\nIn general, observable such as momentum, position, spin, angular momentum, etc, are described by operators.\nHowever, the opposite is not true!

If\n$$\n\\mathbb{A}\\mathbf{v}=\\lambda\\mathbf{v},\n$${#eq-eigenvalue-eq}\n\nwith $\\lambda$ a constant, then this is called the __eigenvalue equation__, where:\n\n- $\\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector of $\\mathbb{A}$,\n- $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that the application of the matrix $A$ on the vector $v$ returned the vector $v$ (in the same direction), but rescaled, with a scaling constant $\\lambda$.\n\nYou can check a visualization of this in the interactive resource embedded below, or found at [this link](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/EigenvectorsAndEigenvalues/Eigenvectors_and_Eigenvalues.html).\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/EigenvectorsAndEigenvalues/Eigenvectors_and_Eigenvalues.html\" id=\"iframe_container\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"450\" width=\"700\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n#### Eigenfunctions (and eigenstates)\n\nWhy do I dig out now the eigenvectors and eigenvalues stuff from the \"forgotten-maths-I-thought-I-no-longer-needed\" pit? (Spoiler: you will need this a lot...)\n\nBecause earlier I mentioned that the time-independet Schrödinger equation (@eq-TISE-H) is an _eigenvalue equation_.\n\nCompare this with the eigenvalue equation in @eq-eigenvalue-eq. Do you see the similarities?\nInstead of having a matrix $\\mathbb{A}$ and a vector $\\mathbf{v}$, we have an operator $\\hat{H}$ and a wavefunction $\\psi(x)$, but the TISE tells me that if I apply the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ on the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$, I get the same wavefunction $\\psi(x)$, but _rescaled_ by a real number which is given by the energy $E$!\n\nSo in analogy with eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can say that in the TISE $\\psi(x)$ is an __eigenfunction__ and $E$ is the __eigenvalue__ (for the energy in this case).\n\n\nIn the previous section we saw two more examples of eigenvalue equations: @eq-p-eigenvalue and @eq-E-eigenvalue.\n\nBelow is a generalised definition of the eigenfunction, analogous to the one for eigenvectors given above. This is _very_ important: the eigenfunctions satisfying eigenvalue equations are the building blocks of quantum states.\n\n:::{.callout-important icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Eigenfunction\n\nAn __eigenfunction__ $\\psi$ of an operator $\\hat{A}$ is a wavefunction that respects the _eigenvalue equation_\n\n$$\n\\hat{A}\\psi = \\lambda \\psi,\n$${#eq-eigenfunction-eq}\n\nfor some scalar _eigenvalue_ $\\lambda$.\n\nThis means that the action of $\\psi$ does not change the wavefunction itself, it only rescales it by some scalar value $\\lambda$.\n\nNote that we use the term eigenfunction when we talk about wavefunctions in the _wave formalism_ of QM, but we could also talk about __eigenstates__, which is usually referred to the same concept but in the matrix formalism of QM.\n:::\n\n## General solution of the TDSE - expansion in energy eigenfunctions {#sec-general-sol-TDSE}\n\nSo now we are getting to the point... the TISE is an eigenvalue equation, and when we say that we want to _solve_ it, for a given Hamiltonian, what we mean is that we want to find the set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for that Hamiltonian! But why is that important?\n\nNow that we added some extra tools to our quantum toolbox, we can _expand on that_ (pun intended, spoilers in the section title) and gain a better understanding of what we can extract from the Schrödinger equation and from its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.\n\nFirst, let's get back to some properties of the stationary states.\nGiven the TISE (@eq-TISE-H), the expectation value of the total energy is\n$$\n\\langle H\\rangle = \\int \\psi^* H \\psi dx = E \\int |\\psi|^2 dx = E,\n$$\n\nwhich results from the normalization of the wavefunction $\\psi(x)$.\nNothing really new so far. Let's now calculate the variance:\n\n$$\n\\Delta H = \\langle H^2 \\rangle - \\langle H \\rangle^2 = E^2-E^2 = 0.\n$$\n\nWhat does it mean that the variance is 0? It means that every time we measure the energy on the eigenstate $\\psi$, the energy we find is going to be _always_ exactly $E$, because the variance of the measurement is 0!\nNow it is clear why we say that stationary state are states with a _well defined total energy_.\n\nSo it seems that stationary states are pretty boring after all: they have a well defined energy, their probability is not evolving with time, they only have a time-evolving global phase, and what do we even do with them? How can we describe any system that evolves with time and does not have a well determined energy? \nRemember how we opened this chapter, emphasising the importance of the superposition principle... this is going to give us something useful here.\n\nStationary states, or eigenstates, are not that useless after all, and this is because _the general time-dependent solution for any system can be obtained from a (weighted) sum of stationary states_ - such a system will have _indeterminate energy_.\n\nSo, the TISE is useful because it gives a set of eigenvalues, $E_1, E_2, E_3,...$ and eigenstates, $\\psi_1(x), \\psi_2(x), \\psi_3(x),...$, from which we can obtain a (total) wavefunction for each allowed value of the energy, i.e.\n$$\n\\Psi_1(x,t)=\\psi_1(x)e^{-iE_1t/\\hbar},\\quad \\Psi_2(x,t)=\\psi_2=(x)e^{-iE_2t/\\hbar},\\, ... .\n$${#eq-eigenstates-list}\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n\nThe eigenstates $\\psi_1(x), \\psi_2(x), ...$ of Hermitian operators are _orthogonal_, meaning that the projection, or _overlap_, of one on the other is zero, or in mathematical terms:\n\n$$\n\\int dx \\psi_i(x)\\psi_j(x) = \\delta(i-j),\n$${#eq-eigenstates-orthogonality}\n\nso the integral is $0$ if $i\\neq j$ and $1$ if $i=j$ (due to the normalization condition).\n:::\n\nNow we can use the superposition principle to solve the TDSE, since if each of the wavefunction in @eq-eigenstates-list is a solution of the TDSE, then a _linear combination_ (i.e. weighted sum) of them is also a solution to the TDSE!\nWe therefore obtain the __general solution__ of the TDSE.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## General solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation\n\nGiven a set of eigenstates $\\psi_i$ and eigenvalues $E_i$ of the TISE, the general solution of the TDSE is given by the linear combination\n\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n \\psi_n(x)e^{-iE_nt/\\hbar}=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n \\Psi_n(x,t),\n$${#eq-TDSE-gen-sol}\n\nwhere $c_n$ are the __amplitudes__ - have the function of \"weights\" for the set of eigenfunctions - and need to be found to determine the correct general solution.\n\nThe general solution has _indeterminate energy_ because the time evolution is not just a global phase now, there is _phase-interference_ arising from the constituent stationary states.\n\n:::\n\n@eq-TDSE-gen-sol means that the eigenfunctions $\\psi_n$ constitute a __complete basis__, so every wavefunction at the time $t=0$ can also be represented as a weighted sum of the eigenstates:\n$$\n\\Psi(x,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} c_n \\Psi_n(x,0).\n$${#eq-TDSE-gen-sol-t0}\n\nSince the time-dependance in the general solution of the TDSE @eq-TDSE-gen-sol is not merely a global phase, the probability of the general state, $|\\Psi(x,t)|^2$ is now going to be also time-dependent, in contrast with the probability of stationary states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(x,t) = |\\Psi(x,t)|^2 &= \\sum_i c_i^* e^{iE_it/\\hbar}\\psi^*_i(x,0)\\sum_j c_j^* e^{-iE_jt/\\hbar}\\psi^*_j(x,0) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i,j} c^*_i c_j e^{-i(E_j-E_i)t/\\hbar}\\psi^*_i(x)\\psi_j(x).\n\\end{aligned},\n$${#eq-gen-prob-TDSE}\n\nwhere you can now see that the _local_ phases $e^{-i(E_j-E_i)t/\\hbar}$ create interference.\n\nThe probability of @eq-gen-prob-TDSE still has to be normalised (its integral must be one), i.e. $\\int P(x,t)dx=1$,  and it follows that\n\n$$\n\\int P(x,t)dx=\\sum_{i,j} c^*_i c_j e^{-i(E_j-E_i)t/\\hbar}\\int dx \\psi^*_i(x)\\psi_j(x) = \\sum_{i,j} c^*_i c_j e^{-i(E_j-E_i)t/\\hbar} \\delta(i-j) = 1,\n$$\n\nwhere we used the property of orthogonality of the eigenstates $\\psi_i$ (cfr. @eq-eigenstates-orthogonality). Therefore, imposing $i=j$, the normalization condition reduces to the following normalization condition for the amplitudes:\n\n$$\n\\sum_i |c_i|^2 = 1.\n$${#eq-normalization-amplitudes}\n\nYou can see get a better understanding of how the principle of superposition works by using the resource at [this link](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/ExpansionTheorem/ExpansionTheorem.html), also embedded below. Given a general solution, we can express this as a sum of eigenstates, weighted by appropriate coefficients (tick the \"show expansion in energy eigenfunctions box to see it\").

Let's see this.\n\nIf we apply @eq-expectation-value-evolution to the operators $\\hat{A}=\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{A}=\\hat{p}$, considering their commutators with the non-relativistic Hamiltonian (@eq-hamiltonian-op)\n$$\n[\\hat{x},\\hat{H}]=[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}^2/2m+U(x)]=[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}^2/2m],\n$${#eq-comm-x-H}\n$$\n[\\hat{p},\\hat{H}]=[\\hat{p},\\hat{p}^2/2m+U(x)]=[\\hat{p},U(x)],\n$$\nusing the commutation properties, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle x \\rangle}{dt}=\\frac{1}{2i\\hbar m}\\langle [\\hat{x},\\hat{p}^2]\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2i\\hbar m}\\langle \\hat{p}[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]+[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]\\hat{p}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2i\\hbar m}\\langle 2i\\hbar\\hat{p} \\rangle,\n$$\n\nwhich generalised to 3D is\n\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle = m\\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{r}\\rangle}{dt}.\n$${#eq-newtonian-momentum}\n\nSimilarly, for the time evolution of the momentum expectation value, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} = -\\langle \\nabla U \\rangle,\n$${#eq-newtons-2nd-law}\n\nwhich is Newton's second law!\n\nThis recovery of classical dynamics in the expectation values of quantum mechanics is __Ehrenfest’s Theorem__.\nIt is an important example of the general correspondence principle introduced by Bohr in his first nuclear-atom construction, which applied to large atomic number Z: that in the large-system statistical limit, quantum mechanics is consistent with classical physics.\n\nQM is the fundamental physics, with classical behaviours being a handy approximation in systems where quantum features like wavefunction collapse and amplitude interference are “washed out” by the incoherent superposition of many different contributions to the total wavefunction.\n\nOnly a few special systems such as carefully prepared superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates are able to propagate quantum effects to macroscopic scales — although the consequences of fundamentally quantum effects are immensely important in ensuring a few trifling details like the stability of matter, the distribution of structure in the universe, and solar fusion.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- In general the Hamiltonian is the generator of time-evolution for a (quantum) system.\n- A state of definite energy is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, and its time-evolution is just a phase $\\propto Et/\\hbar$.\n- For time-independent potentials, the time-independent Schrödinger equation can be obtained from the time-dependent one; obtain stationary states by assuming wavefunction separable into $r$ and $t$ parts.\n- The TISE is an eigenvalue equation, and the corresponding eigenfunctions and eigenfunctions are used to obtain stationary states.\n- The general solution for the TDSE can be obtained from a linear combination of the stationary states with a definite energy.\n- Wavefunctions must be square-integrable, continuous everywhere, and smooth except at infinite potential steps.\n- Expectation values also time-evolve with the Hamiltonian: static operators which commute with the Hamiltonian have time-invariant expectation values.\n- Ehrenfest’s theorem results from this: expectation values of position and momentum obey Newton’s Laws, cf. correspondence principle.\n\n",
