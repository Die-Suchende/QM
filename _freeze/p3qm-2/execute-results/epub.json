Understanding the concept of wave-particle duality and its experimental confirmations\n2. Applying the concepts of wavefunctions and probability amplitudes to describe free particles as matter-waves\n3. Understand the Heisenberg uncertainty principle's origin and its implications\n\n_The content of this lecture is mostly covered in Chapter 1 of Feynman's lectures [@Feynman:1494701]._\n\n-----------\n\n## Wave-particle duality\n\nIn the previous chapter we saw how classical physics is not sufficient to describe a series of phenomena, and that we need to introduce concepts such as _quantisation_ of energy and _wave-particle duality_ that applies not only to light, but also to matter.\n\nIn the following we will see that matter waves, in analogy to light, can be described by quantities called __wavefunctions__. The physical meaning of these is not immediate, as they differ from conventional water, sound or light waves, but we will discuss this further later in the chapter and it will become more clear after we go through different variations of the double-slit experiment.\n\n\n\n## The double-slit experiment\n\nA typical experiment that shows the wave-particle duality is the double-slit experiment, which you have already seen in other courses such as \"Classical and Quantum Waves\" and will be briefly discussed here.\n\n### Feynman's lectures\n\nIf you want a thorough description of the wave-particle duality, the double-slit experiment and how this impacted the development of quantum physics, there are endless resources you can read, including the books in the suggested reading list. I have a personal preference in this regard, and it's provided by Feynman. His \"Lectures on Physics\" are freely available online [here](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html) (also embedded below), and I recommend reading the first three chapters of the third book (or at least the first one - the third gets more technical). They are very descriptive, so do not be scared by the length, but they are very useful for a fundamental understanding of the physics behind the mathematical description!\n\nFeynman did a pretty fine job at going through this extensively in three chapters, so forgive me if I don't make an effort at reinventing the wheel by trying to reformulate what he perfectly explains, I'll just summarise these concepts briefly and use them to introduce some notation that we will keep using for the rest of the course and that you need to familiarise yourself with.\n\nThe two chapters from Lectures on Physics can be found at the following links, also embedded below.\nI will mainly focus on the first chapter for the various double-slit experiments, while the second chapter is more focused on understanding of the implications of the previous experiments and how these relate to the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\n- [Chapter 1 - Quantum behaviour](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html)\n- [Chapter 2 - The Relation of Wave and Particle Viewpoints](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_02.html)\n<!-- - [Chapter 3 - Probability Amplitudes](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_03.html) -->\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html\" id=\"iframe_container\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"450\" width=\"700\"></iframe>\n<!-- <iframe src=\"https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_02.html\" id=\"iframe_container\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"450\" width=\"700\"></iframe> -->\n<!-- <iframe src=\"https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_03.html\" id=\"iframe_container\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" height=\"450\" width=\"700\"></iframe> -->\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Experiment 1: An experiment with bullets\n\nLet's start with our double-slit setup for the first experiment with bullets: a machine gun shooting bullets, a wall with two slits (each just big enough to let one bullet go through), and a backstop with a detector, where the bullets stop and accumulate.\n\nLet's break down the experiment in three phases:\n\n__1. Only slit #1 open__\n\nLet's suppose to divide the screen in squares with sides of length $\\Delta x$, and of shooting a total of $N$ bullets.\n\nWhat we observe is a distribution of bullets $N_1(x)$, giving a probability $P_1(x)=N_1(x)/N$ of finding a bullet, coming from slit 1, at the position $x$ (see $P_1$ in @fig-feynman-bullets). A bullet could hit the edge of the slit and be deflected in its trajectory, so we can't know _exactly_ where the bullet would go, but can know what the probability that it will be found at the coordinate $x$ of the backstop would be.\nThis probability distribution will be a bell curve, centered around the coordinate aligned with the slit.\n\n\n__2. Only slit #2 open__\n\nIf now we close slit 1 and open slit 2, we will have the same kind of result as for phase 1, but now with the bell curve $P_2=N_2(x)/N$ centered around the coordinate aligned with the second slit (see $P_2$ in @fig-feynman-bullets).\n\n__3. Both slits open__\n\n_What do we observe if both slits are open?_\nFor the purpose of this experiment, let's stick with the assumption that bullets are _indivisible_ and macroscopic and arrive one per time at the backstop. They will either go through slit 1 or slit 2. The total probability that the bullet will hit a position $x$ in the screen is the sum of the individual probabilities $P_1$ and $P_2$ obtained when only one of the slits is open (see $P_{12}$ in @fig-feynman-bullets):\n$$\nP_{12}(x)=P_1(x)+P_2(x).\n$$ \n\n\n![Double slit experiment with bullets. Source: @Feynman:1494701](img/feynman_bullets.jpg){#fig-feynman-bullets}\n\n__No interference is observed in this experiment!__\n\n### Experiment 2: An experiment with waves\nLet's consider the same setup, but instead of a gun shooting bullets, let's now consider a wave source, such as water waves, and a screen which measures the \"intensity\" of the wave motion.\nConcentric wavefronts propagate from a point source and hit the two slits, which we can then consider as point-like sources of secondary waves (using Huygen's principle, which you should remember from the course on Waves). The setup is illustrated in (@fig-feynman-waves).\n\n![Double-slit experiment with waves. Source: @Feynman:1494701](img/feynman_waves.jpg){#fig-feynman-waves}\n\nWhat we observe is that if we cover one of the two slits, we have the intensity bell curves indicated with $I_1$ or $I_2$ in @fig-feynman-waves.\nHowever, if both slits are open, the waves interfere and form a pattern with maxima and minima of intensity, corresponding to positions where they interfere constructively and destructively, respectively.\n\nIn contrast to the previous experiment with bullets, where the total probability as a function of space was the sum of the two probability distributions, here the intensity observed is not simply the sum of the two intensities obtained when one of the slits is closed: $I_{12}\\neq I_1 + I_2$.\n\nThe key point here is that we cannot simply consider a sum of intensities, we need to consider the waves _amplitudes_: the intensity is in fact proportional the modulus square of the amplitude.\nThis means that, if the amplitudes of the secondary waves coming from slits 1 and 2 are respectively $h_1$ and $h_2$, the corresponding intensities with only one slit open are $I_1 = |h_1|^2$ and $I_2=|h_2|^2$ (see @fig-feynman-waves). However, when both slits are open, the total intensity will be given by the square of the _sum of the amplitudes_:\n$$\nI_{12} = |h_1+h_2|^2.\n$$\n\n__Interference is observed with waves!__\n\n### Experiment 3: An experiment with electrons\n\n_What do we expect to observe in an experiment with electron guns that send one electron per time through two slits?_\n\nThe set-up is similar to the one in the first experiment, except that now the gun is shooting electrons instead of bullets, and at the screen we have a detector of electron that \"clicks\" every time an electron hits it.\n\nSince we are shooting electrons, one per time, we would expect something like the probability distribution in the first experiment with bullets...\n\n...however, this is not what we observe (not always at least - we'll get back to this soon).\n\nWhat we observe is illustrated in @fig-feynman-electrons.\n\n![Double-slit experiment with electrons. Source: @Feynman:1494701](img/feynman_electrons.jpg){#fig-feynman-electrons}\n\n__Do electrons split across the two slits?__\n\nEvery \"click\" registered has always the same loudness - each electron detected is always a whole _localised_ entity with its own mass and charge. No half electrons are detected, ever!\nThis means that _electrons do not split across the two slits_.\n\n__So does this mean that each electron goes either through slit 1 or slit 2?__\n\nNo, because if that was the case, the probability $P_{12}$ would just be the same of $P_1$ and $P_2$, as with experiment 1. Instead, $P_{12}\\neq P_1+P_2$: there is interference!\n\nSo in the same experiment electrons behave like _waves while in transit, before they get detected_, but behave like _particles upon detection_.\n\nAfter all, the same experiment can be done with light, and in that case we observe the same interference patter. In that case we can think of the interference of electromagnetic waves, in the light-as-wave description, but in the detection process light behaves as a particle, since it is detected by the photoelectric effect, which needs a (quantised) photons description to be explained (see previous chapter). Even sending one photon per time, the interference pattern is observed, so it is not a result of more photons interfering.\n\n__Ok, but maybe since electrons are charged they just interfere with each other and form that interference pattern?__\n\nNo, actually the same pattern is observed also if you use neutrons, so it does not depend on the charge, it really depends on the _nature_ of matter and how it manifests in different scenarios.\n\nWe can see where this is going: wave-matter duality.\nThe interference pattern that we obtain in this experiment is analogous to the one we saw for intensity in experiment 2.\nIn that case, we saw that the apparently complicated pattern of the intensity is actually very simple if we consider the sum of the wave amplitudes, which are physical and related to the oscillating electric and magnetic fields.\nBut then, how do we explain this with electrons? We need to introduce a concept analogous to the classical wave amplitudes and to the classical waves, but for probabilities.\nSo we come up with an analogous concept to describe the wave behaviour of matter: the _wavefunction_, introduced at the beginning of the chapter, playing the role of _probability amplitude_.\n\nIn this experiment we use the symbol $\\phi$ for the wavefunction, so the probability is $P = \\phi^*\\phi = |\\phi|^2$.\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-important}\n\nWavefunctions, used to describe matter waves, are quite different from waves like water, sound or electromagnetic waves: they are _not_ measurable quantities, they are represented by __complex numbers__, so they _do not directly define probabilities_, but are used to find them. To have physically \"meaningful\" measurable quantities, we need to obtain _real_ values, so we use the modulus square of wavefunctions (or probability amplitudes) to obtain the probabilities.\n\n::: -->\n\nIf an event - like the detection of a particle on the screen - can happen following different possible paths, we associate a wavefunction (or probability amplitude - a complex number) to each path. \nIn this case, for two slits, we have two probability amplitudes $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ associated to each possible trajectory.\nThe probabilities of detecting a particle at the screen, coming from slit 1 and slit 2 respectively (when one of the slits is closed), are therefore $P_1=|\\phi_1|^2$ and $P_2=|\\phi_2|^2$. \n\nWhen both slits are open, the total probability of observing a particle at the screen is _not_ the sum of these two probabilities.\nIn analogy with the intensity for waves calculated from the square of amplitudes, the total probability is obtained from the modulus square of the _total probability amplitude_ $\\phi_1+\\phi_2$:\n$$\nP_{12}=|\\phi_1+\\phi_2|^2=|\\phi_1|^2+|\\phi_2|^2+2|\\phi_1||\\phi_2|\\cos\\theta.\n$${#eq-P12_slits_interference}\n\nIn this case we say that the electron is in a __superposition state__ $\\phi=\\phi_1+\\phi_2$.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nNote that the last term in @eq-P12_slits_interference, $2|\\phi_1||\\phi_2|\\cos\\theta$, is an interference term that makes the difference between this experiment and the classical case with no interference. $\\theta$ is the phase between the two complex wavefunctions $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$.\n\n:::\n\nThe mathematics is exactly the same as the one that we have for classical waves once we introduce the concept of probability amplitude!\n\n__Interference is observed in this experiment with electrons (or neutrons)!__\n\n### So is the electron a wave, a particle or both?\n\nThere are different interpretations about the wave-particle duality of matter, and maybe the most accepted answer to the above question is... _neither_ (not at the same time at least!).\n\n> Electrons behave like waves on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, like particles on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and like nothing at all on Sundays.\n\n-- Readapted version of Sir Lawrence Bragg's quote (originally for light).\n\nElectrons (and other matter) can behave like either particles ot waves, depending on the kind of experiment performed on them, but _never_ behave like both waves and particles _simultanously_.\n\nThis statement reflects Bohr's concept of __complementarity__.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Complementarity\n\nAccording to the _complementarity principle_, pairs of _complementary quantities_, like wave and particle properties, can't be measured simultaneously.\nThe principle of complementarity is not limited to the wave-particle duality, but can be applied to other complementary quantities such as position and momentum, therefore extending to the uncertainty principle.\n:::\n\n> The ultimate origin of the difficulty lies in the fact (or philosophical principle) that we are compelled to use the words of common language when we wish to describe a phenomenon, not by logical or mathematical analysis, but by a picture appealing to the imagination. Common language has grown by everyday experience and can never surpass these limits. Classical physics has restricted itself to the use of concepts of this kind; by analyzing visible motions it has developed two ways of representing them by elementary processes: moving particles and waves.\nThere is no other way of giving a pictorial description of motions — we have to apply it even in the region of atomic processes, where classical physics breaks down.\nEvery process can be interpreted either in terms of corpuscles or in terms of waves, but on the other hand it is beyond our power to produce proof that it is actually corpuscles or waves with which we are dealing, for we cannot simultaneously determine all the other properties which are distinctive of a corpuscle or of a wave, as the case may be. We can therefore say that _the wave and corpuscular descriptions are only to be regarded as complementary ways of viewing one and the same objective process_, a process which only in definite limiting cases admits of complete pictorial interpretation.\n\n-- M. Born, Atomic Physics, fourth edition, New York, Hafner Publishing Co., 1946, p. 92.\n\n### Experiment 4: An experiment with electrons... but we monitor the electrons through the slits!\n\nStrange things happen when we add a strong light source between the two slits (as in @fig-feynman-electrons-observed), so when the electron passes through a slit, it scatters some light and we can know which one it went through by seeing which aperture the \"flash\" comes from.\n\n![Double-slit experiment with electrons and a light source between the slits to observe the electrons' path. Source: @Feynman:1494701](img/feynman_electrons_observed.jpg){#fig-feynman-electrons-observed}\n\n__What do we observe once we start shooting electrons?__\nEvery time we hear a \"click\" (we detect an electron at the screen), we also see a flash, either coming from slit 1 or slit 2. However, we _never_ observe two flashes coming from both slits!\n\nSo were we wrong when in the previous experiment we said that electrons do not go through either slit 1 or slit 2?\nNot really, because if we keep shooting electrons, we see something unexpected: the interference now disappears! We obtain the same result as in experiment 1 with bullets.\nHowever, if the light close to the slits is turned off, the interference patter of experiment 3 is restored...\nWhat is going on here?\n\nSomething happens when we look at the electrons, their distribution changes, so their motion seems to be affected by the interaction with the light source used to \"see\" the electrons going through the slits. Indeed, the bright light source disturbs the electrons, \"localising\" them.\n\n__What if we try to use a less bright source, so that the electrons are less disturbed?__\n\nWe can in fact make light dimmer, however the flashes of light observed will not get weaker, what changes is their frequency. With dim enough light, not all \"clicks\" will be preceded by a flash.\nIn fact, reducing the _intensity_ of the light source will not change the size of the photons, only their quantity, hence the rate at which they are emitted (remember the simulation on the photoelectric effect in the previous chapter). This explains why some electrons can go through a slit without scattering light at times, because at times there is no photon around while the electron travels!\nLet's keep running this experiment with dim light anyway and let's build two different histograms of the detections to reconstruct the probability distribution for the two different cases: when we see the flash and when we do not see the flash.\nIf we keep the count of the detections where a flash is observed, we obtain the total distribution $P'_{12}$, without interference, of @fig-feynman-electrons-observed.\nHowever, for the counts of detections for which a flash was not observed, we obtain again the interference pattern $P_{12}$ of @fig-feynman-electrons!\nWe can confirm that __if electrons are not seen, we have interference!__\n\n__What if we use a light with a lower frequency?__\n\nThe kick given to the electrons by light depends on the momentum of the photons, $p=h/\\lambda$, so if we want to decrease this, we should increase the wavelength using light at lower frequencies (e.g. infrared or radio), not lower intensities!\nIf we try the experiment with increasingly lower frequencies, nothing seems to change, until we eventually try with light of wavelength comparable to the distance between the slits. Maybe you can guess what happens here though... if the wavelength is comparable to or longer than the distance between the slits, then we can't distinguish these as two separate spots! So what we see in this case is just a big fuzzy flash, but we would not be able to tell whether it comes from slit 1 or slit 2, so we can't tell which slit the electron went through.\nFor such wavelengths then we start seeing again the interference pattern of @fig-feynman-electrons.\n\nThis phenomenon is actually a consequence of the _uncertainty principle_, which will see in the rest of the chapter, and for which we can give this alternative statement:\n_it is impossible to design an experiment to determine through which slit the electron passes without destroying the interference pattern by disturbing the electron._\n\n## Wavefunctions and Born's probability interpretation\n\nWe introduce the concept of __wavefunctions__ to describe the wave property of matter in analogy to light.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n## Wavefunction\n\nA wavefunction $\\Psi(\\vec{r},t)$ is a complex number associated to a particle (in the matter wave description of QM) and it is used to calculate the probability of finding the particle in a small region of space at a given time $t$, according to _Born's interpretation_.\n\n:::\n\nWavefunctions, used to describe matter waves, are quite different from waves like water, sound or electromagnetic waves: they are _not_ measurable quantities, they are represented by __complex numbers__, so they _do not directly define probabilities_, but _probability amplitudes_ that are used to find probabilities. To have physically \"meaningful\" measurable quantities, we need to obtain _real_ values, so we use the modulus square of wavefunctions (or probability amplitudes) to obtain the probabilities.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=\"true\"}\n\n## Probabilities from wavefunctions - Born interpretation\n\nFor a one-dimensional wavefunction $\\Psi(x,t)$, the __probability density of finding a particle__ in an infinitesimal region between $x$ and $x+dx$ is\n$$\nP(x,t)dx=|\\Psi(x,t)|^2 dx = \\Psi(x,t)^*\\Psi(x,t) dx.\n$${#eq-prob-density-wavefunction-1D}\n\n- The probability of finding the particle in a finite region $a\\leq x \\leq b$ is\n$$\nP(x,t) = \\int_a^b |\\Psi(x,t)|^2 dx.\n$${#eq-wavef-prob-interval}\n\n- Since the particle must be somewhere along the $x-$axis where the wavefunction is defined, the total probability of finding the particle in that region must be equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x,t)|^2 dx = 1.\n$${#eq-normalization-wavefunc}\n\nThis is the __normalization condition__ that we always need to make sure is satisfied by a wavefunction:\n:::\n\nIf you consider the wavefunction at a fixed time $T$, the probability of finding the particle in a certain interval along $x$ is given by the area under the curve described by $|\\Psi(x,T)|^2$.\n\n![Probability of finding a particle in the interval $a\\leq x \\leq b$, given the wavefunction $\\Psi(x,T)$ at a given time $T$.

[Add solution to third part] -->\n</details>\n\n\n## The wave formalism for free particles\n\nThis part is based on the second chapter of Feynman's lectures.\n\nWe saw that the de Broglie wavelength (@eq-de-broglie-wavel) implies that a particle with a momentum $p$, like an electron, has to have an associated wavelength $\\lambda$: $p=h/\\lambda$.\n\nSo how do we represent this matter wave having this wavelength?\n\n### Free particle as plane wave?\n\n\nThe most simple thing to describe a wave with a given wavelength is to consider a traveling plane wave.\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Plane wave representation\n\nIn one dimension and in the complex plane, a plane wave has the form\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=A e^{i(kx-\\omega(k) t)}=A[\\cos(kx-\\omega(k)t)+i\\sin(kx-\\omega(k)t)],\n$${#eq-plane-wave-complex}\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wavenumber and $\\omega=\\nu/(2\\pi)$ is the angular frequency.\n:::\n\n\nFrom the Planck equation @eq-plancks-energy we can write the energy in the form\n$$\nE = h\\nu = \\hbar\\omega.\n$$\n\nNote that in the next section, for simplicity of visualization, we will be using the real part of the plane wave\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=A\\cos(kx-\\omega t),\n$${#eq-plane-wave}\nbut we will get back to using @eq-plane-wave-complex later on.\nConsidering _complex_ wavefunctions in quantum mechanics is fundamental due to the probabilistic nature of quantum physics. While in classical mechanics the complex part of waves is \"physical\", in quantum mechanics wavefunctions are intrinsically complex because they are used to define the probability and introduce phase factors that are not directly measurable, but have measurable consequences such as the interference in the double-slit experiment.\n\n\n#### Dispersion relations\n\nFrom @eq-plane-wave-complex we see that the frequency $\\omega$ depends on the wavenumber $k$. The functions relating the time-dependence and space-dependence of physical entities, with either $\\omega(k)$ or $E(p)$, is given by the _dispersion relations_.\n\n__Dispersion relation for non-dispersive systems__\nFor non-dispersive systems, the dispersion relation is _linear_\n$$\n\\omega(k)=vk,\n$${#eq-dispersion-rel-non-disp}\nwhere $v$ is the wave speed.\n\n__Dispersion relation for light__\n\nThe dispersion relation for light (in vacuum) is also a _linear_  function:\n$$\nc=\\lambda \\nu = \\omega/k = E/p \\implies \\omega(k)=ck.\n$${#eq-disp-rel-light}\n\n__Dispersion relation for a non-relativistic particle__\n\nFor a non-relativistic particle, using @eq-de-broglie-wavel, we can derive the relation between the momentum and the wavenumber:\n$$\np=\\hbar k,\n$$\nand combining this with the definition of kinetic energy and the Planck equation\n$$\nE = \\frac{p^2}{2m}=\\frac{\\hbar^2k^2}{2m} = \\hbar\\omega,\n$$\nwe get the (_quadratic_) dispersion relation for a Newtonian (non-relativistic) particle\n$$\n\\omega(k) = \\frac{\\hbar k^2}{2m}.\n$${#eq-dispersion-relation}\n\n__Dispersion relation for a relativistic particle__\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the energy is \n$$\nE=\\sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4}-mc^2.\n$$\nFor $p\\ll mc$, this reduces to \n\n#### Plane waves derivatives\n\nThe space and time derivatives of plane waves are \n$$\n-i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial x} = \\hbar k \\Psi = p \\Psi,\n$$\n$$\ni\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = \\hbar \\omega(k) \\Psi = E \\Psi.\n$$\n\n\n\n#### Issues with free particles as plane waves\n\nIf the plane wave describes the wavefunction for a free particle, it means that since this must be continuous and extending to infinity with the same amplitude, we could find the particle _everywhere_ in space with the same probability ($|\\Psi(x,t)|^2=A^2$), which does not seem right. In fact, if we consider the uncertainty on the position of the particle, $\\Delta x$, as being (roughly) the region across which the wavepacket extends, we can see (@fig-wavepackets-ab (a)) that this is a _big_ uncertainty - so big that it goes to infinity!\nThe plane wave has the same intensity everywhere and it is _fully delocalised_.\n\nThere is another issue... Let's try to impose the normalisation condition considering a fixed time, e.g. $t=0$ for simplicity:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x,t)|^2 dx = |A|^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos^2 (kx) dx \\to |A|^2 \\times \\infty.\n$$\n\nIn theory this should be equal to $1$ in order to be normalised, but we see that there is a problem: this integral does not converge, so this wavefunction _can't be normalised_. This means that we can't describe the free particle simply as a plane wave because it would be _unphysical_.\n\nIt seems that having one single wavelength (or wavenumber, or momentum value), does not really do the job. What we would need is something to make this wave more \"localised\" in space. Remember however that the wavefunction still needs to extend across the whole space, from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$, but naturally go to $0$ beyond a certain range where we expect to find the particle (remember that the wavefunction has to be also smooth, continuous and single-valued).\nHow do we obtain something that has zero amplitude somewhere and is contained in a wavepacket of length $\\Delta x$, like the one shown in @fig-wavepackets-ab (b)?\n\n![(a) Wavefunction of the free particle as a plane wave - the uncertainty in position extends to infinity; (b) Wavepacket \"localised\" in a length $\\Delta x$.](img/wavepackets.png){#fig-wavepackets-ab}\n\nAs Feynman says: let's add more waves!\n\n### Superposition of two plane waves\n\nLet's try to add more waves having different wavelengths (corresponding to more values of momentum based on the de Broglie wavelength). \n\nLet's start by adding two waves of different wavelengths.

We're still not in the ideal case of having one _localised wavepacket_, but it seems that adding more waves (and more momenta) helps and reduces the uncertainty of the position. It is worth noting that by adding two waves of different wavelengths, because of the de Broglie wavelength, we have two possible values of momentum that we could observe, which means that we _increased the uncertainty of momentum_, and this leads to a _reduced uncertainty of the position_. This is not a case, and we will make more clarity on this by the end of the chapter.\n\nWe also see that adding two waves with the same amplitude and different wavenumbers, we obtain a series of wave \"envelopes\" travelling at a group velocity that is different from the velocity of the individual waves. This will be clarified in the following.\n\nLet's see how mathematically we get these \"envelopes\" by considering the sum of (the real part of) two plane waves with equal amplitude $A$, different wavenumbers $k_1$ and $k_2=k_1+\\Delta x$ and different frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2=\\omega_1+\\Delta\\omega$:\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t) = \\Psi_1(x,t) + \\Psi_2(x,t) = A [\\cos(k_1 x - \\omega_1 t) + \\cos(k_2 x - \\omega_2 t)].\n$${#eq-2waves-superp_1}\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos a+\\cos b=2\\cos\\left( {\\frac{1}{2}(a-b)}\\right) \\cos\\left({\\frac{1}{2}(a+b)}\\right)$, from @eq-2waves-superp_1 we obtain\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=2\\cos\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\Delta k x-\\Delta \\omega t)\\right]\\cos\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(2k+\\Delta k)x-\\frac{1}{2}(2\\omega+\\Delta\\omega)t\\right],\n$${#eq-2waves-superp_2}\nand since $\\Delta k \\ll k$ and $\\Delta\\omega \\ll \\omega$, the last cosine term in @eq-2waves-superp_2, describing the wave _within the envelope_ is $\\cos\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(2k+\\Delta k)x-\\frac{1}{2}(2\\omega+\\Delta\\omega)t\\right]\\approx \\cos[kx-\\omega t]$.\nTherefore the total wavefunction is\n$$\n\\Psi(x,t)=\\Psi_1(x,t) + \\Psi_2(x,t) =2\\cos\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\Delta k x-\\Delta \\omega t)\\right]\\cos[kx-\\omega t],\n$${#eq-2waves-superp}\ngiving the envelope illustrated in @fig-2waves-superp for $t=0$.\n\n![Resultant wavefunction of @eq-2waves-superp, for $t=0$.](img/wavepacket_speed_envelope.png){#fig-2waves-superp}\n\n#### Phase and group velocities\n\nThe wave within the envelope moves at the __phase velocity__ given by the term $\\cos[kx-\\omega t]$\n$$\nv_p=\\frac{(2\\omega+\\Delta\\omega)/2}{(2 k+\\Delta k)/2}\\approx \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\frac{\\omega(k)}{k}.\n$${#eq-phase-velocity}\n\n<!-- where in the last passage we used the dispersion relation @eq-dispersion-relation.

Now we have introduced enough mathematical notation to see that with the FT properties:\nif we Fourier-transform a single-frequency plane wave, we obtain the Dirac delta-function of @eq-dirac-delta.\n\nThe same goes, in theory, if we consider a plane wave in $k$-space: we will have a Dirac delta in position space (extremely localised).\n\nHowever, once we start adding more components in $k$-space (or position space), we narrow down the localisation in the complementary position (or wavenumber/momentum) space, as shown in @fig-uncertainty-wavepackets.\n\n![Position $x$ and momentum $p=\\hbar k$ wavefunctions corresponding to quantum particles.

Many thought experiments can be constructed around attempts to circumvent this limit, always failing due to some consequence of the variables’ conjugacy.\n\n- It is also responsible for avoiding the in-spiral and collapse of the Bohr atom: as an electron falls in and becomes localised near the nucleus at $r = 0$, its root-mean-square momentum increases, and hence so does its kinetic energy: the ground state of minimum energy is not located at $r = 0$, but instead at a finite distance and electrostatic potential.\n- The Hesenberg's uncertainty principle is also central in the natural spectral linewidths, which arises from @eq-heisenberg-inequality-et.\n\n#### Uncertainties in the double-slit experiment\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty relation also explains why the interference pattern disappears in the double-slit experiment, if we _observe_ the path of individual particles. This is in short because the observation of the position (which reduces the uncertainty $\\Delta x$) will increase the uncertainty in the momentum sufficient to destroy the interference pattern.\nLet's see this a bit more in detail.\n\n![Setup of the double slit experiment to (try to) determine which slit the electron goes through.](img/heisenberg-young.png){#fig-double-slit-uncertainty}\n\nIn order to understand which slit the particle goes through, we place some particles right behind the slits, as shown in @fig-double-slit-uncertainty, to use the recoil of small particles to have information on the path taken by electrons. Too see which slit each electron goes through, we must have an uncertainty on the detecting particle's position\n$$\n\\Delta y\\ll D.\n$${#eq-uncertainty-slit-y}\nAlso, during the collision, the detecting particle changes its momentum of a quantity $\\Delta p_y$, equal and opposite to the electron's change in momentum.\nIf the electron is not deviated by an observation, it hits the screen producing the interference pattern having a first minimum given by (see @fig-double-slit-uncertainty)\n$$\n\\tan\\theta \\approx \\theta =\\frac{p_y}{p_x}=\\frac{h}{2p_x D}.\n$$\n\nIn order to preserve the interference pattern we should therefore have\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta p_y}{p_x}\\ll \\theta = \\frac{h}{2p_x D}\\implies \\Delta p_y\\ll \\frac{h}{2D}\n$$\nboth for the electron and the detecting particle (since their change in momentum is the same).\nTherefore, from @eq-uncertainty-slit-y we would obtain\n$$\n\\Delta p_y \\Delta y \\ll \\frac{h}{2D}D=\\frac{h}{2},\n$$\n\nwhich clearly violates the Heisenberg uncertainty principle @eq-heisenberg-inequality-xp! In fact, any possible experiment we can imagine aimed at determining which slit the electron goes through, would give an uncertainty in momentum that is too big to still obtain the interference pattern.\n\n#### Uncertainties in the harmonic oscillator\n\nThis will be more clear when we do the quantum harmonic oscillator, but for now we can anticipate that the ground state (state of minimum energy) of the quantum harmonic oscillator has non-zero energy, and this is due to the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\nThe (classical) harmonic oscillator is given by the following energy:\n$$\nE = T+V = \\frac{p^2}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^2 x^2,\n$$\n\nwhere the first term is the kinetic energy and the quadratic term is the potential energy.\n\nQualitatively: since the potential is harmonic, if the particle was exactly at the bottom of the potential with zero uncertainty, paradoxically the kinetic term related to the momentum would have to go to infinity because of the uncertainty principle.\n\nFor a quantitative description, we will come back to this after doing the quantum harmonic oscillator.\n\n\n## Summary\n\n- Matter and light exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, depending on the experimental conditions (e.g., electrons in the double-slit experiment)​.\n\n- The wavefunction $\\Psi(x,t)$ is a complex function describing the quantum state of a particle, and the probability density of finding the particle at the position $x$ at time $t$ is proportional to $|\\Psi(x,t)|^2$.\n\n- Quantum states can exist in a superposition, where the total probability amplitude is the sum of individual amplitudes (e.g., $\\Psi=\\Psi_1+\\Psi_2$ in the double-slit experiment).\n\n- A single plane wave is not physically realistic to describe a free particle as this would be infinitely delocalised; we need to add an infinite number of weighted plane waves to form a wavepacket localised in space, obtaining the FT of a wavefunction in momentum space.\n\n- There is a fundamental limit to how precisely two _conjugate variables_ $A$ and $B$ (e.g. momentum and position) can be measured _simultaneously_: $\\Delta A \\Delta B \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, i.e. when one is wide, the other is narrow.\n\n-----------\n\n## References \n\n",
